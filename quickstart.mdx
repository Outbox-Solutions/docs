## Get Started in 3 Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log in to your Outbox AI account and familiarize yourself with the
    dashboard. You'll see an overview of contacts, calls, conversations, status
    breakdowns, and key statistics for all your agents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    Navigate to the Agents tab and create either a voice agent (for
    inbound/outbound calling) or chat agent (for web chat, Messenger,
    Instagram). Use our AI-powered prompt generator to build a complete agent in
    seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Deploy">
    Test your agent directly in the platform, then share a branded demo link
    with clients or deploy it live. All fully white-labelled under your brand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Dashboard

Your dashboard is command central for managing all your AI agents and client accounts.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Key Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Monitor performance at a glance with real-time data on contacts, calls,
    conversations, and status breakdowns. Track success rates, pickup rates, and
    costs across all campaigns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contacts & Conversations" icon="users">
    Add contacts manually for campaigns or sync automatically from GoHighLevel.
    View all chats and calls per contact in one unified conversation view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Call & Chat Logs" icon="phone">

  <Accordion title="Call Scoring" icon="star">
    Every call is automatically rated from 0% to 100% based on performance
    metrics, helping you optimize your agents over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connect GoHighLevel (Optional)

Outbox AI offers native GoHighLevel integration to seamlessly sync contacts, trigger workflows, and manage conversations within your CRM.

<Note>
  GoHighLevel integration is optional but highly recommended for agencies
  already using GHL for client management.
</Note>

### Setting Up Your Integration

For a complete step-by-step guide on connecting your GoHighLevel account, including screenshots and troubleshooting, see our [GoHighLevel Integration Guide](/gohighlevel).

### What You Can Do With GHL Integration

    Trigger outbound AI calls directly from GHL workflows with pre-filled
    contact data.
  </Card>

  </Card>

  leads are added, or send follow-up SMS/emails based on call outcomes.
</Tip>

## Creating Your First Agent

Agents are the core of Outbox AI. Choose the type of agent you want to build and follow the configuration steps below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ðŸŽ¤ Voice Agents">
    Perfect for inbound receptionist duties or outbound calling campaigns. Handle calls 24/7 with natural conversation.

    ### Step 1: Set Your Agent Prompt

    The **Prompt** is the backbone of your agent's behavior â€” what it says, how it handles objections, and what outcomes it aims for.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Describe Your Agent">
        Simply type what you want your agent to do (e.g., "Qualify solar leads and book appointments"). Outbox AI will generate a complete prompt using years of refined frameworks.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review & Customize">
        Review the generated prompt and adjust the tone, objectives, and conversation flow to match your needs.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 2: Add Tools

    Connect your agent to actions for seamless automation:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Calendar Booking" icon="calendar">
        Book appointments via Cal.com or GoHighLevel calendars
      </Card>
      <Card title="Send SMS" icon="message">
        Send follow-up text messages during or after calls
      </Card>
      <Card title="Send Email" icon="envelope">
        Trigger email sequences based on call outcomes
      </Card>
      <Card title="CRM Actions" icon="database">
        Update contact fields, add tags, or trigger workflows
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    ### Step 3: Build Your Knowledge Base

    Give your agent the information it needs to answer questions accurately:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Upload Files" icon="file">
        Upload PDFs, documents, or text files with product info, FAQs, or pricing details.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Scrape Websites" icon="globe">
        Enter your client's website URL and we'll automatically scrape and format the content using Firecrawl.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Paste Text" icon="text">
        Copy and paste any relevant information directly into the knowledge base.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    ### Step 4: Configure Voice Settings

    Customize how your agent sounds and behaves on calls:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Choose Voice" icon="microphone">
        Select from 1,000+ AI voices across different accents, genders, and speaking styles. Preview each voice before selecting.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Select Model" icon="brain">
        Choose the AI model that best fits your use case (speed vs. intelligence trade-off).
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Background Sound" icon="volume">
        Add subtle background sounds like office ambience or silence for a more natural feel.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="First Message" icon="comment">
        Set what your agent says when the call connects (e.g., "Hi, this is Sarah calling from Solar Solutions...").
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Call Forwarding" icon="phone-arrow-up-right">
        Configure phone numbers to forward calls to if needed (e.g., transfer to human agent).
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ðŸ’¬ Chat Agents">
    Deploy on your website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or other messaging platforms for instant responses.

    ### Step 1: Set Your Agent Prompt

    The **Prompt** is the backbone of your agent's behavior â€” what it says, how it handles objections, and what outcomes it aims for.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Describe Your Agent">
        Simply type what you want your agent to do (e.g., "Answer FAQs and collect lead information"). Outbox AI will generate a complete prompt using years of refined frameworks.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review & Customize">
        Review the generated prompt and adjust the tone, objectives, and conversation flow to match your needs.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Step 2: Add Tools

        Trigger email sequences based on conversation outcomes
      </Card>
      <Card title="CRM Actions" icon="database">
        Update contact fields, add tags, or trigger workflows
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    ### Step 3: Build Your Knowledge Base

    Give your agent the information it needs to answer questions accurately:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Upload Files" icon="file">
        Upload PDFs, documents, or text files with product info, FAQs, or pricing details.

      <Accordion title="Paste Text" icon="text">

    </CardGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing & Sharing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test In-Platform">
    Every agent can be tested directly inside the platform. Chat with it or call
    it to see how it performs before going live.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share Demo Links">
    Generate a branded demo link (web call or phone call) and share it with
    clients. This is an excellent way to win new business â€” clients can try the
    agent themselves, fully white-labelled with your branding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Live">
    Once you're happy with the results, deploy your agent to handle real
    customer interactions 24/7.
  </Step>

## White Labelling Your Platform

Make Outbox AI completely yours:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Branding">
    Add your logo, company name, and brand colors to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Custom Domain">
    Point your subdomain (e.g., `app.yourÐ°Ð³ency.com`) to Outbox AI with simple
    DNS records.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email Branding">
    Send all system emails from your own domain, so clients never see Outbox
    branding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Your clients will see it as **your software** â€” Outbox branding won't appear
  anywhere.
