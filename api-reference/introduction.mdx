## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.getoutbox.ai
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an `Authorization` header with your API key. Note that you should pass the API key directly without the 'Bearer' prefix.

```bash
Authorization: your-api-key-here
```

### API Key Types

There are two types of API keys:

- **Company API Key**: Used for company-level operations including:

  - Agent management (agents, files, integrations, tools)
  - Module instances
  - Contacts and conversations
  - Call logs, chat logs, and transcripts
  - Company settings, staff, and phone numbers

- **Agency API Key**: Required for all agency-level operations (`/agency/*` endpoints) including:
  - Agency settings management
  - Managing companies under your agency
  - Agency admin invitations
  - Agency phone number management

You can find your API keys in your dashboard settings. Make sure to use the correct API key type for the endpoints you're accessing.
