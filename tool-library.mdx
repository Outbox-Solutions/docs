## Overview

The Tool Library provides ready-made integrations that your AI agents can use during conversations. No coding required—just add the tool, configure the settings, and your agent can book appointments, send messages, fetch data, and more.

<Tip>
  **How it works:** When you add a tool to your agent, it becomes available for
  the agent to call during conversations. The agent decides when to use each
  tool based on your prompt instructions.
</Tip>

## Variables vs Configurations

Understanding the difference between variables and configurations is key to using tools effectively.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Variables" icon="wand-sparkles">
    **Filled by the agent during the conversation** The agent gathers this
    information from the customer and passes it to the tool. **Examples:** -
    Customer's name - Preferred appointment time - Email address - Phone number
  </Card>

  <Card title="Configurations" icon="gear">
    **Preset when you add the tool** You configure these once, and they stay the
    same for every call/chat. **Examples:** - API keys - Calendar IDs - Default
    timezone - Integration credentials
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:**

When using the "Fetch Free Slots" tool:

- **Configuration:** You set the Calendar ID once (which calendar to check)
- **Variables:** The agent fills in the start_date and timezone during each conversation

# MCP Application Integrations

Connect to 60+ popular applications through MCP application integrations. These applications are available as preset MCP servers—simply authenticate and select which tools you want your agent to access.

<Tip>
  **How it works:** When you add an MCP application integration, you'll
  authenticate your account and then choose specific tools/actions from that
  application. Your agent can then perform those actions during conversations.
  See the [MCP Server section](/chat-agents#mcp-server) for detailed setup
  instructions.

<Note>
  **Authentication Required:** Most applications require OAuth2 or API key
  authentication. When you add an application integration, you'll be guided
  through the authentication process. Some applications may already be
  authenticated if you've connected them previously.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Granular Tool Selection:** After authenticating an application, you can
  choose which specific tools/actions your agent can access. For example, with
  Gmail, you might only allow creating draft emails but not sending or reading
  emails. This gives you fine-grained control over what your agent can do.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Explicit in Your Prompt" icon="message-lines">
    Don't assume the agent will figure out when to use tools. Tell it exactly:
    
    **Bad:**  
    "You can check appointment availability."
    
    **Good:**  
    "When a customer asks about available times, use the Fetch Free Slots tool. Pass their timezone and search the next 7 days. Then read back the available times."
    
    Explicit instructions = reliable behavior.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Chain Tools Together" icon="link">
  Many workflows require multiple tools in sequence: 1. **Find Or Create
  Contact** → Get contact ID 2. **Fetch Free Slots** → Show available times 3.
  **Book Appointment** → Complete the booking Make sure your prompt explains the
  full sequence.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Handle Tool Failures Gracefully" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Tools can fail (API down, no availability, invalid data). Tell your agent what
  to do: "If the booking tool returns an error, apologize and offer to take
  their details manually. Say: 'I'm sorry, our booking system is having a
  moment. Can I take your name and number? I'll have someone call you back
  within 30 minutes to confirm your appointment.'"
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test with Real Data" icon="flask">
  Don't test with fake calendar IDs or invalid credentials: - Use your actual
  production calendars - Test during business hours when slots are available -
  Try booking for real dates - Verify bookings appear in your actual system Test
  with real data or you'll miss issues.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Use Timezones Consistently" icon="earth-americas">
  Timezone mismatches cause booking disasters: - Always set your agent's default
  timezone in settings - Use IANA format (e.g., "America/New_York",
  "Australia/Sydney") - When customers mention times, clarify: "That's 3pm your
  local time in Sydney, correct?" - Store customer timezone in your CRM for
  future calls
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secure Your API Keys" icon="key">
    Many tools require API keys and credentials:
    
    - Never put API keys directly in your prompt
    - Use the Configuration fields (they're encrypted)
    - Rotate keys periodically for security
    - Use separate keys per client when possible
    - Revoke keys immediately if a client leaves
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tool Not Working" icon="wrench">
    **Problem:** The agent isn't using the tool or it's failing.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    1. **Check your prompt:** Does it explicitly tell the agent when to use this tool?
    2. **Verify configurations:** Are all required fields filled in correctly?
    3. **Test credentials:** API keys, calendar IDs, etc. may be incorrect or expired
    4. **Check tool logs:** Look for specific error messages in the conversation transcript
    5. **Test the API directly:** Use Postman or curl to verify your credentials work
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Agent Using Tool at Wrong Time" icon="clock-rotate-left">
  **Problem:** The tool triggers when it shouldn't. **Solutions:** - Make
  conditions more specific in your prompt - Add "only if" clauses: "Only use the
  booking tool AFTER the customer has confirmed they want to book" - Test with
  edge cases where the tool shouldn't trigger - Add explicit examples of when
  NOT to use the tool
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Variables Not Populating" icon="input-text">
  **Problem:** Required variables are missing or empty. **Solutions:** - Ensure
  the agent asks for all required information first - Tell the agent: "Before
  using the booking tool, you MUST have: name, phone, and preferred date" - Add
  validation in your prompt: "If the customer hasn't given you their phone
  number, ask for it before proceeding" - Check that variable names in your
  prompt match the tool's expected names
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Timezone Issues" icon="globe">
  **Problem:** Appointments booking at wrong times. **Solutions:** - Set the
  agent's default timezone in Advanced Settings - Always ask: "What timezone are
  you in?" if customer location is unclear - Use ISO 8601 format with timezone
  offset when possible - Test bookings and verify they appear at correct times
  in your system - For international customers, confirm: "Just to be clear,
  that's 3pm London time, correct?"
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="API Rate Limits" icon="gauge">
  **Problem:** Tool fails with "rate limit exceeded" error. **Solutions:** -
  Most APIs limit requests per minute - For high-volume operations, space out
  tool calls - Contact your integration provider (Mindbody, Cal.com, etc.) to
  increase limits - Implement retry logic in your prompt: "If the tool fails,
  wait 30 seconds and try again"
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Not Showing in Tool Library" icon="eye-slash">
    **Problem:** You don't see a tool you need.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    - Check if you've connected the integration first (e.g., GoHighLevel must be connected before GHL tools appear)
    - Refresh the page
    - Verify your subscription includes that integration
    - Contact support if a documented tool is missing
  </Accordion>
