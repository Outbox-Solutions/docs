## Overview

Workflows allow you to create automated campaigns that respond to AI call outcomes and execute follow-up actions. Build sophisticated automation sequences that handle everything from lead qualification to follow-up messaging, all triggered automatically when your AI agents complete calls.

## How Workflows Work

Workflows consist of **triggers** and **actions**:

1. **Trigger:** An event that starts the workflow (e.g., when an AI call completes)
2. **Filters:** Conditions that determine which calls should trigger the workflow
3. **Actions:** Steps that execute automatically (send calls, SMS, emails, etc.)
4. **Branches:** Conditional logic that routes contacts down different paths

## Triggers

### AI Call Completed

The primary trigger for outbound call workflows. This trigger fires when an AI call finishes, allowing you to respond immediately to call outcomes.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-trigger-ai-call-completed.png"
    alt="AI Call Completed Trigger"
  />
</Frame>

---

### Meta Lead Form Submitted

Trigger a workflow the moment a lead submits a Facebook or Instagram lead form. Ideal for speed-to-lead campaigns where every minute counts.

**Common Uses:**

- Call new leads within seconds of submission
- Send an instant SMS or email confirmation
- Route leads to different workflows based on campaign or form

<Note>
  Requires the **Meta Integration** to be connected in **Settings → Company →
  Integrations**.
</Note>

### Filters

Filters allow you to control which calls trigger your workflow. Only calls that match ALL selected filters will trigger the workflow.

#### Call Status Filter

Filter workflows based on the outcome of the call:

**Available Statuses:**

- **Completed** – Call finished successfully
- **Forwarded** – Call was transferred to a human
- **Voicemail** – Agent left a voicemail message
- **No Answer** – Contact didn't pick up
- **Error** – Technical failure occurred
- **Unqualified** – Contact didn't meet qualification criteria

#### Direction Filter

Filter based on the direction of the call:

**Options:**

- **Inbound** – Only trigger for calls received by your agents
- **Outbound** – Only trigger for calls placed by your agents
- **Web** – Only trigger for web-based calls (e.g., browser-based calling)

#### Score Filter

Filter based on the AI agent's call score:

**Options:**

- **Minimum Score** – Only trigger if score is at least X
- **Maximum Score** – Only trigger if score is no more than X
- **Range** – Trigger only for scores within a specific range

<Note>
  **Score Range:** Scores typically range from 0-100, with higher scores
  indicating better-qualified leads or more successful conversations.
</Note>

#### Agent Filter

Filter based on which AI agent handled the call:

**Options:**

- Select one or more specific agents
- Useful when different agents handle different types of calls
- Allows you to create agent-specific follow-up sequences

---

## Actions

Actions are the steps your workflow takes after being triggered. You can chain multiple actions together to create complex automation sequences.

### Send AI Call

Place an outbound AI call to a contact using one of your voice agents.

**Configuration:**

- **Agent** – Select which voice agent to use for the call
- **From Number** – Choose the phone number to call from
- **First Message** – Set the opening line for the call

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-action-send-ai-call.png"
    alt="Send AI Call Action"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  **Dynamic Variables:** Use `{{contact.first_name}}` and other contact variables in your first message to personalize each call automatically.
</Tip>

---

### Wait

Add a delay between workflow actions. This allows you to space out follow-up actions and create natural conversation timing.

**Configuration:**

- **Duration** – Set how long to wait (seconds, minutes, hours, or days)
- **For call to end** - Wait until a call ends so that you can activate different actions based on the results of the call.

**Use Cases:**

- Wait 24 hours before sending a follow-up call
- Space out multi-touch campaigns (call → wait 2 days → SMS)
- Wait until call ends, if no answer, send SMS

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows-action-wait.png" alt="Wait Action" />
</Frame>

**Example Workflow:**

1. AI Call Completed → Status: No Answer
2. Wait 4 hours
3. Send AI Call (retry attempt)

---

### Drip Mode

Enable drip mode to automatically space out actions over time, creating a natural follow-up cadence.

**Configuration:**

- **Drip Interval** – Time between each action (e.g., every 2 days)
- **Batch Size** - The amount of contacts you want to push through at a time

**How it works:**
Drip mode automatically executes actions at set intervals without requiring manual scheduling. Perfect for managing concurrency.

**Use Cases:**

- Throttling campaigns that run through a few thousand contacts at a time.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows-action-drip-mode.png" alt="Drip Mode Action" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  **Drip vs. Wait:** Drip mode is ideal for ongoing sequences, while Wait is
  better for one-time delays between specific actions.
</Tip>

---

### Send SMS

Send a text message to the contact's phone number.

**Configuration:**

- **Message Content** – Write the SMS message
- **From Number** – Select the phone number to send from

**Use Cases:**

- Follow up after calls with additional information
- Send links or resources mentioned during the call
- Quick check-ins for leads that didn't answer

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows-action-send-sms.png" alt="Send SMS Action" />
</Frame>

**Example Messages:**

```
Hi {{contact.first_name}}, thanks for your interest! Here's the link we discussed: [link]
```

```
{{contact.first_name}}, just following up on our call. Let me know if you have any questions!
```

---

### Send Email

Send an email to the contact using your configured email provider.

**Configuration:**

- **From Email** – Select the email address to send from
- **Subject** – Set the email subject line
- **Body** – Write the email body content
- **Custom Email List** (Optional) – Select a custom email list to send to

**Use Cases:**

- Send detailed information after a call
- Follow up with resources, pricing, or documentation
- Appointment confirmations with calendar invites
- Nurture sequences for long-term leads

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows-action-send-email.png" alt="Send Email Action" />
</Frame>

**Best Practices:**

- Keep subject lines concise and relevant
- Personalize content using contact variables
- Include clear call-to-action buttons
- Test email rendering across different clients

---

### Add to Workflow

Add the contact to another workflow, allowing you to chain workflows together or move contacts between sequences.

**Configuration:**

- **Target Workflow** – Select which workflow to add the contact to

**Use Cases:**

- Move qualified leads from general nurture to sales sequence
- Transfer contacts between different campaign types
- Create workflow hierarchies (parent → child workflows)
- Route contacts based on call outcomes

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-action-add-to-workflow.png"
    alt="Add to Workflow Action"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Contacts can be in multiple workflows simultaneously. Use this action to add
  them to additional sequences without removing them from the current workflow.
</Note>

---

### Remove from Workflow

Remove the contact from a workflow, stopping further automation for that contact in that specific sequence.

**Configuration:**

- **Target Workflow** – Select which workflow to remove the contact from

**Use Cases:**

- Stop automation when contact converts or opts out
- Remove contacts who have been handled manually
- Clean up workflows by removing unqualified contacts
- Prevent duplicate automation when contacts are in multiple workflows

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-action-remove-from-workflow.png"
    alt="Remove from Workflow Action"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Always remove contacts from workflows when they convert or
  explicitly opt out to avoid sending unwanted follow-ups.
</Tip>

---

### Add Contact Tag

Add a tag to the contact for organization, segmentation, and filtering.

**Configuration:**

- **Tags** – Add multiple tags at once

**Use Cases:**

- Tag contacts based on call outcomes ("Hot Lead", "Follow Up Needed")
- Segment contacts by score ("High Score", "Low Score")
- Mark contacts for specific campaigns ("Solar Interest", "Appointment Booked")
- Organize contacts by status ("Qualified", "Unqualified")

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-action-add-tag.png"
    alt="Add Contact Tag Action"
  />
</Frame>

**Example Tags:**

- `hot-lead`, `warm-lead`, `cold-lead`
- `appointment-booked`, `callback-requested`
- `no-answer`, `voicemail-left`
- `high-score`, `qualified`, `unqualified`

---

### Remove Contact Tag

Remove a tag from the contact, useful for cleaning up tags or updating contact status.

**Configuration:**

- **Tags** – Remove multiple tags at once

**Use Cases:**

- Remove outdated tags when contact status changes
- Clean up tags when contacts move between stages
- Remove temporary tags used for filtering
- Update contact segmentation

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/workflows-action-remove-tag.png"
    alt="Remove Contact Tag Action"
  />
</Frame>

**Example Workflow:**

1. AI Call Completed → Score > 80
2. Remove Tag: "Cold Lead"
3. Add Tag: "Hot Lead"

---

### If/Else

Create conditional branches in your workflow based on call status or score. This allows you to route contacts down different paths depending on call outcomes.

**Configuration:**

- **Condition Type** – Choose "Call Status" or "Score"
- **Condition Logic** – Set the comparison (equals, greater than, less than, etc.)
- **If Path** – Actions to execute if condition is true
- **Else Path** – Actions to execute if condition is false

**Condition Types:**

**Call Status:**

- Equals: Completed, Forwarded, Voicemail, No Answer, Error, Unqualified
- Not Equals: Any status except the specified one

**Score:**

- Greater Than: Score is above X
- Less Than: Score is below X
- Equals: Score equals exactly X
- Between: Score is within a range

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/workflows-action-if-else.png" alt="If/Else Action" />
</Frame>

**Example Workflows:**

**Example 1: Route by Score**

```
If Score > 80:
  → Add Tag: "Hot Lead"
  → Send Email: "High Priority Follow-Up"
  → Notify Sales Team
Else:
  → Add Tag: "Warm Lead"
  → Send SMS: "Thanks for your interest!"
  → Add to Workflow: "Nurture Sequence"
```

**Example 2: Route by Call Status**

```
If Status = "Completed":
  → Add Tag: "Engaged"
  → Send Email: "Thank You"
  → Wait 3 days
  → Send AI Call: "Follow-Up"
Else If Status = "No Answer":
  → Wait 4 hours
  → Send AI Call: "Retry"
Else:
  → Add Tag: "Needs Attention"
  → Send SMS: "We tried to reach you"
```

<Tip>
  **Complex Logic:** You can nest If/Else branches to create sophisticated
  routing logic. Start simple and add complexity as needed.
</Tip>

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: No-Answer Retry Sequence

**Goal:** Retry calls that didn't get answered

**Workflow:**

1. Trigger: AI Call Completed → Filter: Status = "No Answer"
2. Wait: 4 hours
3. Send AI Call: Retry with different first message
4. If/Else: Score > 70 → Add Tag "Engaged", Else → Add Tag "Low Interest"

---

### Pattern 2: High-Score Immediate Follow-Up

**Goal:** Immediately follow up on highly qualified leads

**Workflow:**

1. Trigger: AI Call Completed → Filter: Score > 80
2. Add Tag: "Hot Lead"
3. Send Email: "High Priority Follow-Up" (immediately)
4. Send SMS: "Quick follow-up" (wait 1 hour)
5. Add to Workflow: "Sales Sequence"

---

### Pattern 3: Drip Nurture Campaign

**Goal:** Maintain contact with leads over time

**Workflow:**

1. Trigger: AI Call Completed → Filter: Status = "Completed"
2. Enable Drip Mode: Every 3 days, max 4 actions
3. Action 1: Send Email (Day 0)
4. Action 2: Send SMS (Day 3)
5. Action 3: Send AI Call (Day 6)
6. Action 4: Send Email (Day 9)

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Channel Follow-Up

**Goal:** Follow up across multiple channels

**Workflow:**

1. Trigger: AI Call Completed → Filter: Status = "Completed"
2. Send Email: "Thank you for your time" (immediately)
3. Wait: 1 day
4. Send SMS: "Quick question" (Day 1)
5. Wait: 2 days
6. Send AI Call: "Follow-up call" (Day 3)
