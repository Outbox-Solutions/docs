## Custom Fields & Custom Values

Custom Fields and Custom Values allow you to extend your company settings with additional data that can be referenced in your agent prompts.

### Custom Fields

Custom Fields are fields that can be assigned to contacts. When contacts are uploaded or created, these custom fields can be set and then referenced in agent prompts using dynamic variables.

**Use Cases:**
- Store contact-specific information like membership type, lead source, or referral code
- Track custom attributes that aren't part of standard contact fields
- Personalize agent conversations based on contact-specific data

**How to Use:**

1. **Create Custom Fields:**
   - Navigate to **Settings → Company** within your company workspace
   - Find the **Custom Fields** section
   - Add new custom fields with names like `membership_type`, `lead_source`, `referral_code`, etc.

2. **Assign to Contacts:**
   - When uploading contacts via CSV or API, include your custom field values
   - Custom fields can also be set when creating contacts programmatically

3. **Reference in Agents:**
   - Use the format `{{contact.custom_field_name}}` in your prompts
   - Example: `"Hi {{contact.first_name}}, I see you're interested in our {{contact.membership_type}} membership."`

<Tip>
Custom Fields are perfect for storing data that varies per contact, like membership tiers, appointment preferences, or custom tags.
</Tip>

### Custom Values

Custom Values are company-specific values that can be set once and referenced across all your agents. This allows you to update company-wide information in one place rather than updating every agent individually.

**Use Cases:**
- Company address, phone number, or business hours
- Standard pricing or service descriptions
- Company-wide policies or messaging
- Any information that should be consistent across all agents

**How to Use:**

1. **Create Custom Values:**
   - Navigate to **Settings → Company** within your company workspace
   - Find the **Custom Values** section
   - Add new custom values with names like `company_address`, `business_hours`, `support_email`, etc.

2. **Set the Values:**
   - Enter the value for each custom value field
   - These values are shared across all agents in your company

3. **Reference in Agents:**
   - Use the format `{{company.custom_value_name}}` in your prompts
   - Example: `"Our office is located at {{company.company_address}}. Would you like directions?"`

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** If your company address changes, update it once in Custom Values rather than editing every agent prompt. All agents will automatically use the new address!
</Tip>

**Example:**

If you set a custom value called `company_address` with the value `"123 Main Street, Perth, WA 6000"`, you can reference it in any agent prompt:

```markdown
You are a receptionist for {{company.name}}.

Our office is located at {{company.company_address}}.
When customers ask for directions, provide this address.
```

If you later move to a new location, simply update the `company_address` custom value once, and all your agents will automatically use the new address.

## Billing & Usage

Track usage and profitability for each company account.

### Hide Billing

New **Hide Billing** toggle lets you hide call/chat costs from company users. This is useful when you want to keep internal margins private while still giving clients access to the rest of the platform.

**Where to find it:** **Settings → Company → Billing**

### Usage Dashboard

View detailed metrics for each subaccount:

- **Cost** – How much the usage cost your agency
- **Revenue** – How much you charged the client
- **Profit** – Your margin (Revenue - Cost)

This gives you full visibility into which clients are most profitable and helps with pricing optimization.

## Advanced Rebilling Settings

Configure automated billing rules for each company account.

  />
</Frame>

### Rebill Option

Toggle rebilling on or off for the company. When off, you'll need to bill the client manually.

### Retainer Fee (Optional)

```
Retainer Fee: $0.00 USD/month
```

Set a fixed monthly fee that will be charged to this company each month, regardless of usage.

### Chat Multiplier

```
Chat Multiplier: 1.0x
```

Multiplier applied to the cost of each chat message response. For example:

- `1.0` = Pass through cost at 0% markup
- `1.5` = 50% markup on chat costs
- `2.0` = 100% markup on chat costs

### Call Rate (per minute)

```
Call Rate: $0.16/min
```

The rate charged to your client per call minute (excluding VOIP provider costs). This is your margin on voice calls.

### Agent Limit (Optional)

```
Agent Limit: Unlimited
```

Set the maximum number of agents this company can create. Leave empty for unlimited agents.

### Concurrent Lanes

```
Concurrent Lanes: 10 (Max: 25)
```

Control how many simultaneous calls the client can handle at once. This prevents resource abuse and helps manage infrastructure costs.

## Rebilling Options

Choose how you want to collect payment from your clients.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Off">
    Rebilling is disabled. You'll need to invoice clients manually through your
    own system.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="GHL Wallet">
  Automatically charge the client's GoHighLevel Wallet balance.
  <Warning>
    Only available if you own **GoHighLevel Agency-Pro** with Rebilling enabled.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Draft">
  Generate an invoice draft that you can review before sending to the client.
  **Best for:** Agencies that want to review invoices before they go out.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Invoice">
  E-mail a final invoice automatically. The client pays manually via Stripe's
  payment link. **Best for:** Clients who prefer to review and pay invoices
  manually.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Charge">
  Automatically charge the stored card on the 1st of each month. **Best for:**
  Fully automated billing with reliable clients.
  <Info>Requires the client to have a valid payment method on file.</Info>
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Direct Billing">
    Bill the client directly through their own payment method.
    
    <Warning>
      **This will break whitelabel functionality.** The client will see Outbox
      branding instead of your agency branding.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set competitive but profitable rates">
    Research market rates for AI voice and chat agents. A typical markup is
    50-100% on infrastructure costs, but you can charge more based on the value
    you provide (custom integrations, dedicated support, etc.).
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Use retainer fees for predictable revenue">
  If you're providing ongoing support or maintenance, add a retainer fee. This
  creates predictable MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) for your agency.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Start with Stripe Draft for new clients">
  When onboarding new clients, use Stripe Draft mode so you can review usage and
  costs before sending the first invoice. Once you're comfortable with their
  usage patterns, switch to automatic charging.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set concurrent lane limits appropriately">
    Don't give unlimited concurrent lanes unless the client has committed to
    high-volume usage. Most small businesses need 3-5 lanes, while call centers
    might need 10-25.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client isn't receiving invitation emails">
    - Check that the email address is correct - Ask them to check spam/junk
    folders - Try resending the invitation - Verify your email service isn't
    blocking outbound mail
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe charges are failing">
  - Ensure the client has a valid payment method on file - Check if their card
  has expired - Verify the card has sufficient funds/credit available - Consider
  switching to Stripe Invoice mode for manual payment
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Usage costs seem incorrect">
    - Check the date range you're viewing - Verify the call duration calculation
    (some providers round up) - Review the chat message count and token usage -
    Ensure your multipliers and rates are set correctly
  </Accordion>
