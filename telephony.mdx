## Overview

Outbox AI supports three carriers: **Twilio**, **Vonage**, and **Telnyx**. Each shines in different markets and price brackets. This guide will help you pick the right one for every client.

<Tip>
  **Quick Recommendation:** - üá∫üá∏ **US/Canada traffic?** Use Twilio (best
  reliability and features) - üåç **International traffic?** Use Vonage
  (per-second billing saves money) - üí∞ **Cost-conscious international?** Use
  Telnyx + Twilio combo (best rates in AU/UK/NZ/Europe)
</Tip>

## Choosing a Provider

Compare the three carriers to find the best fit for your use case.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Twilio" icon="/images/twilio.svg">
    **Best for:** United States (and Canada)

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ Quick, self-serve setup‚Äîbuy numbers in minutes
    - ‚úÖ High concurrency limits‚Äîperfect for large campaigns
    - ‚úÖ Built-in voicemail detection (saves wasted agent talk-time)
    - ‚úÖ **Verified Caller ID** lets you mask calls with a client's existing phone number
    - ‚úÖ Direct GoHighLevel SMS integration‚Äîsame number for calls and texts

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå Charges **by the minute** (rounded up), so a 9-second voicemail costs a full minute
    - ‚ùå Non-US pricing is steep‚Äîabout **7¬¢ USD per minute** in Australia

    <Tip>
      **Rule of thumb:** If the traffic is US-centric, stick with Twilio every time.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vonage" icon="/images/vonage.png">
    **Best for:** Non-US regions where per-second billing matters

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ **Bills per second**‚Äîa 30-second call costs half a minute
    - ‚úÖ Slightly cheaper headline rates than Twilio outside the US

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå No native voicemail detection (Outbox uses its own transcript-based fallback)
    - ‚ùå No verified caller IDs
    - ‚ùå **On-boarding is manual:** email a rep, fill in forms, wait for approval
    - ‚ùå No GoHighLevel SMS tie-in, so you'll juggle separate SMS and voice numbers

    <Note>
      **When to use:** Mid-size international campaigns where per-second pricing outweighs the admin hassle.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Telnyx" icon="/images/telnyx.png">
    **Best for:** International markets (AU, UK, NZ, Europe) when cost is king and you still want Caller ID masking

    ### Strengths

    - ‚úÖ **Significantly cheaper than Twilio** in most international markets (40-60% savings)
    - ‚úÖ Supports **verified caller IDs**‚Äîpair it with a Twilio SMS number for a "one-number" experience
    - ‚úÖ Modern dashboard, good documentation
    - ‚úÖ Competitive rates in AU, UK, NZ, and European countries

    ### Weak Points

    - ‚ùå Charges by the minute (no per-second savings)
    - ‚ùå Occasional reliability quirks: sudden number blocks, quirky concurrency caps
    - ‚ùå No built-in voicemail detection
    - ‚ùå No direct GoHighLevel SMS integration (hence the Twilio-plus-Telnyx combo)

    ### Practical Hybrid Stack

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Twilio for SMS + Inbound">
        Buy a Twilio number ‚Üí connect to GoHighLevel for SMS + inbound voice
      </Step>
      <Step title="Telnyx for Outbound">
        Buy a Telnyx number ‚Üí set Twilio number as a verified caller ID
      </Step>
      <Step title="Save on Costs">
        Make outbound calls via Telnyx and save 40-60% on international rates
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Works great in:** AU, UK, NZ, and most European countries

  </Accordion>

## Twilio Setup

Twilio is the gold standard for US/Canada traffic. Follow these steps to set up a number and connect it to Outbox AI.

### 1. Create (or Open) a Sub-Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Visit [console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sub-Accounts">
    Click your workspace name ‚Üí **Sub-Accounts** ‚Üí **Create new sub-account**

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/telephony-twilio-subaccount.png" alt="Twilio Sub-Account" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  If Twilio shows multiple "regions", always leave it on **US1** so Outbox AI
  can reach the logs.
</Tip>

---

### 2. Build the Regulatory "Bundle" (If Required)

Many countries require proof-of-business before you can purchase phone numbers. Twilio calls this a "regulatory bundle."

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-twilio-regulatory.png"
    alt="Twilio Regulatory Bundle"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  **US/Canada toll-free and local numbers** typically don't require bundles.
  **Mobile numbers** in most countries (including AU, UK, NZ) do require
  compliance documentation.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Regulatory Compliance">
    In the left menu choose **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Regulatory Compliance**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Bundle">
    Click **Create Bundle** and fill in: - **Country:** Select your target
    country - **Number Type:** Mobile, Local, or Toll-Free - **Business Type:**
    Independent software vendor (or appropriate category)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Twilio typically asks for: - **Business name** - **Business address** -
    **Business registration number** (ABN for AU, EIN for US, Companies House
    for UK, NZBN for NZ) **Accepted documents:** - Utility bills - Lease
    agreements - Business registration certificates - Tax documents Each file
    must show at least two of the required data points; upload multiple files if
    needed. **Registry Links:** - [ASIC
    (Australia)](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/) - [Companies House
    (UK)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) - [New
    Zealand Companies Office](https://www.companiesoffice.govt.nz/)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit and Wait">
    Submit; approval usually takes 24-48 hours depending on the country
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Buy a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Buy a Number">
    After the bundle is approved (or immediately for US/Canada), go to **Phone
    Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy a number**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter by Country and Capabilities">
    Filter for your **target country** and **Capabilities = Voice & SMS**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Number">
    Select a number that matches your needs: - **Mobile** (AU: 614, UK: 447, NZ:
    642) - Best for SMS + voice - **Local** (US/Canada area codes) - Geographic
    presence - **Toll-free** (US: 800/888, AU: 1800, UK: 0800) - Free for

### 4. A2P Registration (US SMS Only)

If you're sending SMS messages to US numbers, you **must** register for A2P (Application-to-Person) messaging. This is a US regulation to reduce spam.

<Warning>
  **Required for US SMS:** Without A2P registration, your SMS messages to US
  numbers will be blocked or heavily throttled (limited to ~5 messages per
  minute).
</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/telephony-twilio-a2p.png" alt="A2P Registration" />
</Frame>

#### What is A2P?

A2P (Application-to-Person) registration is required by US carriers for business SMS messaging. It verifies that you're a legitimate business sending approved content.

**Two Options:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Registration (Recommended)" icon="shield-check">
    **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
    **Cost:** ~$15-50 one-time fee  
    **Throughput:** Up to 4,500 messages per minute

    **Requirements:**
    - Business EIN (Employer Identification Number)
    - Business website
    - Business address
    - Description of your SMS use case
    - Sample message templates

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to A2P Registration">
        Twilio Console ‚Üí **Messaging** ‚Üí **Regulatory Compliance** ‚Üí **A2P 10DLC**
      </Step>
      <Step title="Register Your Business">
        Submit your business information and EIN
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Brand">
        Describe your brand and how you'll use SMS
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create Campaign">
        Define your use case (appointment reminders, customer service, marketing, etc.)

        Submit sample message templates
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait for Approval">
        Approval typically takes 4-6 weeks. You'll receive email updates on progress
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign Numbers">
        Once approved, assign your US numbers to the campaign
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
      Start the A2P process **immediately** after buying your number. The 4-6 week wait is unavoidable, so don't delay!
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low Volume (Quick Start)" icon="gauge-simple-min">
    **Timeline:** Instant  
    **Cost:** Free  
    **Throughput:** Only 5-10 messages per minute

    If you're just testing or sending very low volumes, you can skip full A2P registration. However, your messages will be heavily throttled.

    <Warning>
      **Not suitable for production:** Low volume limits make this impractical for real campaigns. Only use for testing or tiny-scale operations.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Non-US Numbers

If you're **not** sending SMS to US numbers (e.g., AU ‚Üí AU, UK ‚Üí UK), you can skip A2P registration entirely. It's only required for US SMS traffic.

<Note>
  **International SMS:** Other countries have their own regulations, but most
  don't require pre-registration like the US does. Always check local
  requirements for your target market.
</Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-twilio-caller-id.png"
    alt="Twilio Verified Caller ID"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  **Important:** Verified IDs work for **outbound only**; inbound calls still
  land on the Twilio number.
</Note>

---

## Vonage Setup

Vonage bills by the second and can be cheaper than Twilio outside the US, but the onboarding is more manual. Follow these steps to secure a number and connect it to Outbox AI.

### 1. Log In and Fund the Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Dashboard">
    Visit [dashboard.nexmo.com](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) (same portal,
    simply re-branded as Vonage)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Balance">
    Add a small balance‚ÄîVonage won't let you request numbers on a ¬£0 wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### 2. Request a Phone Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Buy Numbers">
    In the left sidebar, click **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy Numbers**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Number">Choose the target country and search</Step>
  <Step title="Request (Not Buy)">
    Click **Request**; instead of instant purchase, the portal creates a ticket
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Documents">
    A Vonage rep emails you for supporting documents‚Äîusually: - Proof of
    business name and address (utility bill, lease, ASIC extract, etc.) -
    Business registration ID (ABN, Companies House number, EIN, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Approval">
    Email the files back; approval typically lands within 24‚Äì48 hours The number

</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/telephony-vonage-api-credentials.png"
    alt="Vonage API Credentials"
  />
</Frame>

---

### 4. Connect Vonage to Outbox AI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Numbers">
    Your purchased numbers populate in the list‚Äîassign as needed to voice agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Telnyx Setup

Telnyx often offers lower per-minute rates than Twilio in many international markets (especially AU, UK, and Europe), but it lacks GoHighLevel SMS integration and native voicemail detection.

<Card title="Recommended Strategy" icon="lightbulb">
  **Use Twilio** for inbound and SMS (so everything lands in GoHighLevel) **Use
  Telnyx** for outbound voice, masking the calls with the same Twilio number
  through "verified caller ID" This gives you the best of both worlds: Twilio's
  reliability + Telnyx's pricing.
</Card>

---

### Option A ‚Äì Quick & Dirty (Use the Telnyx API Key)

If you only need Telnyx voice and don't care about masking:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Visit [portal.telnyx.com](https://portal.telnyx.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Buy a Number">
    Buy a number under **Numbers** ‚Üí **Search & Buy** (submit any required
    documents)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy API Key">Copy your **API Key**</Step>
  <Step title="Add to Outbox AI">
    In Outbox AI, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Company** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí
    **Telnyx** and paste the key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Number">
    The number appears under **Telephony** ‚Üí **Numbers**‚Äîassign it to a voice
    agent
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Drawback:** Calls will display that raw Telnyx number and SMS must be
  handled elsewhere.
</Warning>

---

### Option B ‚Äì The "Masked" Stack (Recommended)

This setup combines Twilio's reliability with Telnyx's cost savings. Perfect for international markets where Telnyx offers better rates.

<Note>
  **Popular in:** Australia, UK, New Zealand, and European markets where Telnyx
  rates are significantly lower than Twilio.
</Note>

#### Step 1 ‚Äì Secure a Twilio SMS / Inbound Line

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy Twilio Number">
    Purchase a Twilio number in your target country, plug the **SID & Auth
    Token** into Outbox AI, and connect it to GoHighLevel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to your agent">
    Keep this number for **inbound calls** and **all texting**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to GoHighLevel (Optional)">
    Add this number into your GoHighLevel account if you want SMS Capabilities
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

    Telnyx charges **by the minute** (unlike Vonage's per-second billing). A 61-second call costs 2 minutes.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test Concurrency" icon="gauge">
  Telnyx occasionally rate-limits new numbers. If calls start failing, raise a
  support ticket to increase limits.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Watch for Blocks" icon="ban">
  Keep an eye on "number blocked" errors mid-campaign. Swap a fresh Telnyx
  number if needed.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with One Provider" icon="seedling">
    Don't try to set up all three at once. Pick the best fit for your primary market and master it first.
    
    - **US/Canada clients?** Twilio
    - **International clients (per-second billing)?** Vonage
    - **Cost-conscious international (AU/UK/NZ/Europe)?** Telnyx + Twilio combo
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Use Sub-Accounts for Client Separation" icon="users">
  Create separate sub-accounts (Twilio) or labeled numbers (Vonage/Telnyx) for
  each client. This makes billing tracking and troubleshooting 10x easier.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test Before Going Live" icon="flask">
  Always send test calls before launching campaigns: 1. Test inbound and

    **Problem:** Your A2P 10DLC registration is taking too long or was rejected.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    **If Stuck (over 6 weeks):**
    - Contact Twilio support with your campaign ID
    - Check for any pending actions in the A2P dashboard
    - Verify your business EIN is valid and matches official records
    
    **If Rejected:**
    - Review the rejection reason carefully
    - Common issues:
      - Sample messages look like spam or scams
      - Business website doesn't match your description
      - Use case is unclear or too broad
      - EIN doesn't match business name
    - Revise your campaign description to be more specific
    - Provide clearer sample message templates
    - Resubmit with corrections
    
    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Be very specific in your campaign description. Instead of "marketing messages," say "appointment reminders and booking confirmations for dental practice patients."

  <Accordion title="US SMS Still Throttled After A2P" icon="gauge-simple-min">
    **Problem:** SMS messages are still slow even after A2P approval.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify your phone number is actually assigned to the approved campaign
    - Check campaign status‚Äîit may show "approved" but still be processing
    - Allow 24-48 hours after approval for full throughput to activate
    - Review your campaign's assigned throughput tier (some use cases get lower limits)
    - Contact Twilio if throttling persists beyond 48 hours
