## Overview

A well-crafted prompt is the foundation of every successful AI agent. This guide walks you through the essential components of great prompts, from basic structure to advanced techniques that will make your agents feel truly human.

<Tip>
  **Quick Start:** When creating a new agent, simply add a description in the
  "Create Agent" modal and Outbox AI will automatically generate a professional
  prompt for you! You can then refine it using the guidance below.
</Tip>

---

## AI-Powered Prompt Generation

Outbox AI makes prompt writing easier with built-in AI assistance.

### When Creating an Agent

<Frame>

    alt="Agent Description"
  />
</Frame>

When you create a new agent, add a description of what you want the agent to do. Outbox AI will automatically generate a complete, professional prompt based on your description.

**Example Description:**

```
I need a receptionist for my dental practice that can book appointments,
answer common questions about our services, and handle emergency inquiries
with a friendly, professional tone.
```

The AI will generate a fully structured prompt with all the necessary sections, ready for you to customize.

---

### Generate Button

Already have an agent? Use the **Generate** button to let AI adjust your existing prompt based on new instructions.

**How it works:**

1. Click the **Generate** button in the prompt editor
2. Describe what you want to change or improve
3. AI rewrites your prompt with the updates
4. Review and save the changes

**Example:**

- "Make the tone more casual and friendly"
- "Add a section about our new pricing tiers"
- "Include instructions for handling refund requests"

<Note>
  The Generate button is perfect for iterating on your prompts without starting
  from scratch!
</Note>

---

## General Prompt Structure

Break your prompt into six key sections for maximum clarity and effectiveness.

### 1. Role & Objective

Define who the agent is and what they should accomplish.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Role" icon="user-tie">
    **Who is the agent?**
    
    State the business name, location, and the agent's specific function.

    **Examples:**
    - "You are the inbound receptionist for Elite Fitness, Perth, Australia."
    - "You are a customer service agent for Bright Solar Solutions."
    - "You are the sales assistant for CrossFit Downtown, helping prospects book their first class."

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Objective" icon="bullseye">
    **The single outcome you want on each call or chat.**

    Make it crystal-clear. Every conversation should drive toward this goal.

    **Examples:**
    - "Your goal is to book a free consultation appointment."
    - "Your objective is to qualify the lead and determine if they're a good fit."
    - "Your purpose is to upsell existing members to the premium tier."

    <Tip>
      Keep it to ONE primary objective per agent. Multiple objectives create confusion.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### 2. Sales Script (Flow Blocks)

Break your script into logical chunks rather than writing one long paragraph. This makes the agent's decision-making faster and more accurate.

#### Key Checkpoints

Structure your conversation flow with clear milestones:

1. **Greeting** – How should the agent open the conversation?
2. **Discovery questions** – What information do you need to gather?
3. **Pitch** – How do you present the offer or solution?
4. **Close/next step** – How do you move toward the objective?

**Example:**

```markdown
## Conversation Flow

### 1. Greeting

"Hi! Thanks for reaching out to Elite Fitness. How can I help you today?"

### 2. Discovery

Ask about:

- Their fitness goals
- Previous gym experience
- Preferred workout times

### 3. Pitch

"Based on what you've told me, our [SPECIFIC MEMBERSHIP] would be perfect.
It includes [RELEVANT BENEFITS]."

### 4. Close

"I can get you booked in for a free tour this week.
Does Tuesday or Thursday work better for you?"
```

#### Conditional Branches

Handle different scenarios with clear if/else logic:

**Example:**

```markdown
## Conditional Logic

**If** the caller only wants pricing:

- Provide the basic price
- Emphasize value ("That includes unlimited classes plus...")
- Offer a free trial to see the facility

**Else if** the prospect isn't the decision-maker:

- Get the decision-maker's name and number
- Offer to send information via email
- Schedule a follow-up call when both parties are available

**Else if** they're calling about a specific promotion:

- Confirm the promotion details
- Create urgency ("This offer ends Friday")
- Book them in immediately
```

<Note>
  Clear branches prevent the agent from rambling or mixing up scenarios.
</Note>

#### Extras

Include special data the agent needs so it never has to ask you:

- Today's class schedule
- Current promotions and expiry dates
- Staff availability
- Temporary closures or changes

**Example:**

```markdown
## Current Schedule

**Monday-Friday:** 5am - 9pm
**Saturday:** 7am - 5pm  
**Sunday:** 8am - 2pm

**Special Note:** We're closed December 25-26 for Christmas.

## Active Promotions

**New Year Special:** 50% off first month (expires Jan 31)
**Referral Bonus:** Existing members get $50 credit for each referral
```

---

### 3. FAQs

Present common questions and model answers. Use simple Q ➜ A pairs—tables aren't necessary.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** What's the address?  
**A:** 1920 St George's Terrace, Perth, 6000 WA.

**Q:** How much is membership?  
**A:** We have three tiers:

- Basic ($29/week) - Access during off-peak hours
- Standard ($45/week) - Unlimited access + group classes
- Premium ($65/week) - Everything plus personal training sessions

**Q:** Do I need to sign a contract?  
**A:** No lock-in contracts. You can pause or cancel anytime with 14 days notice.

**Q:** What should I bring to my first class?  
**A:** Just comfortable workout clothes, a water bottle, and a positive attitude!
We provide all equipment.
```

<Tip>
  Include anything callers ask repeatedly: opening hours, cancellation policy,
  current promos, parking information, what to wear, etc.
</Tip>

---

### 4. Common Objections & Rebuttals

List the top push-backs your staff hear and give the agent a winning response.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Handling Objections

**"I need to think about it."**  
→ "Of course! Would a quick follow-up call tomorrow help you decide?
I can also send you our member testimonials if that'd be helpful."

**"That's too expensive."**  
→ "I totally understand. Keep in mind that breaks down to just $6.50 per day—
less than a coffee! Plus we offer flexible payment plans.
Would fortnightly payments work better for your budget?"

**"I don't have time right now."**  
→ "No problem! Most of our members felt the same way at first.
Our early morning sessions at 5am and late evening slots at 8pm
are super popular with busy professionals.
Would one of those times suit you better?"

**"I'm not sure I'll actually use it."**  
→ "That's exactly why we offer the free 7-day trial!
Come try a few classes with zero commitment.
Most people who try it end up loving it.
Can I book you in for a trial this week?"
```

<Warning>
  Don't script defensive or argumentative responses. Keep rebuttals positive and
  solution-oriented.
</Warning>

---

### 5. Tonality & Personality

Define how the agent should sound. This is what makes the difference between a robotic interaction and a natural conversation.

**Key Elements:**

```markdown
## Tone & Personality

**Voice & Style:**

- Friendly Australian vibe, informal but respectful
- Use casual language ("Hey," "no worries," "awesome!")
- Mirror the caller's energy level

**Natural Speech:**

- Natural fillers are allowed ("um," "ah," "well," "let me check that for you")
- Never sound robotic or overly scripted
- Pause naturally when thinking or looking something up

**Numbers & Formatting:**

- Write numbers as words where possible (e.g., "twenty-five," not "25")
- Say dates conversationally ("Tuesday the fifteenth" not "15/01/2025")

**Handling AI Questions:**

- Don't announce you're AI up-front
- Never lie if asked directly
- If asked, respond: "I'm an AI assistant helping the team.
  I can handle most questions, but I'm happy to connect you with
  a human if you'd prefer."
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example: Professional & Formal" icon="briefcase">
    "Good morning, thank you for contacting [COMPANY]. 
    This is [AGENT NAME], how may I assist you today?"
    
    - Use complete sentences
    - Avoid slang or colloquialisms
    - Maintain respectful distance
    
    **Best for:** Legal, medical, financial services, B2B
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Example: Casual & Friendly" icon="face-smile">
  "Hey! Thanks for reaching out. What can I help you with?" - Use contractions
  ("I'm," "we're," "that's") - Inject personality and warmth - Be conversational
  **Best for:** Fitness, hospitality, retail, consumer services
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Example: Energetic & Sales-Focused" icon="bolt">
  "Hi there! Super excited to hear from you! Let's find the perfect solution for
  what you need!" - High energy and enthusiasm - Action-oriented language -
  Create urgency and excitement **Best for:** Sales calls, limited-time offers,
  event bookings
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example: Empathetic & Supportive" icon="heart">
    "Thanks for calling. I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. 
    Let me help you sort this out."
    
    - Acknowledge emotions
    - Show patience and understanding
    - Problem-solving focus
    
    **Best for:** Customer support, technical help, complaints handling
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### 6. Response Style Guidelines

Control how the agent structures its responses and manages the conversation flow.

**Guidelines:**

```markdown
## Response Style

**Brevity:**

- Keep replies concise—no rambling
- Get to the point quickly
- One idea per response

**Questioning:**

- Ask ONE clear question at a time, then wait
- Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- Let the caller finish before moving on

**Confirmation:**

- Confirm key details before progressing
- Repeat back: dates, email addresses, phone numbers, spelling of names
- Example: "Just to confirm, that's J-O-H-N at john@email.com, correct?"

**Closing:**

- End every successful interaction with the agreed next step
- Example: "Perfect! I've got you booked for Tuesday at 3pm.
  You'll receive a confirmation email in the next few minutes.
  Looking forward to seeing you then!"

**Errors & Uncertainty:**

- If unsure, admit it rather than guessing
- Offer to find out: "Let me check with the team and call you back"
- Provide alternatives when you can't do exactly what's requested
```

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Test your agent with intentionally vague or confusing inputs to
  see how well it handles uncertainty.
</Tip>

---

## Dynamic Variables

Dynamic variables let your agent personalize every conversation without hard-coding details. They behave like mail-merge tags: write the variable once, and Outbox AI swaps in the live value when the conversation starts.

Dynamic variables work in both **chat and voice agents**, allowing you to reference contact information, company details, and custom data throughout your prompts.

---

### Variable Structure

Dynamic variables use a structured format organized by category:

**Contact Variables:**
- Access information about the current contact
- Format: `{{contact.field_name}}`
- Includes custom fields assigned to contacts

**Company Variables:**
- Access company-specific information
- Format: `{{company.field_name}}`
- Includes custom values set at the company level

---

### Contact Variables

Use contact variables to personalize conversations with information about the current contact:

**Standard Contact Fields:**

```markdown
{{contact.first_name}} – Contact's first name
{{contact.last_name}} – Contact's last name
{{contact.email}} – Contact's email address
{{contact.phone}} – Contact's phone number
{{contact.company_name}} – Contact's company (for B2B)
{{contact.time_zone}} – Contact's timezone
{{contact.location}} – Contact's city or region
```

**Custom Fields:**

Custom fields that you've created in Company Settings can be accessed using:

```markdown
{{contact.custom_field_name}} – Any custom field assigned to contacts
```

For example, if you created a custom field called `membership_type`, you would reference it as:

```
{{contact.membership_type}}
```

---

### Company Variables

Use company variables to reference company-specific information that can be updated once and used across all agents:

**Standard Company Fields:**

```markdown
{{company.name}} – Company name
{{company.address}} – Company address
{{company.phone}} – Company phone number
{{company.email}} – Company email address
```

**Custom Values:**

Custom values that you've set in Company Settings can be accessed using:

```markdown
{{company.custom_value_name}} – Any custom value set at the company level
```

For example, if you created a custom value called `company_address`, you would reference it as:

```
{{company.company_address}}
```

<Tip>
**Why use Custom Values?** If your company address changes, you only need to update it once in Company Settings rather than updating every agent prompt individually.
</Tip>

---

### Example Usage

**Voice Agent First Message:**

```markdown
"Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is Sarah from {{company.name}}.
I'm calling about your inquiry regarding our {{contact.membership_type}} membership.
Our office is located at {{company.company_address}}.
Do you have a quick minute to chat?"
```

**Chat Agent Prompt:**

```markdown
You are a customer service agent for {{company.name}}.

When greeting customers, use their name: "Hi {{contact.first_name}}!"

Our office address is {{company.company_address}}.
If customers ask about our location, provide this address.
```

**Appointment Reminder:**

```markdown
"Hey {{contact.first_name}}! Just a friendly reminder that you've got
a session booked with us tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you at
{{company.company_address}}!"
```

---

### Syntax Rules

- **Format:** `{{category.field_name}}` (e.g., `{{contact.first_name}}` or `{{company.name}}`)
- **Categories:** Use `contact.` for contact fields, `company.` for company fields
- **Custom Fields:** Access custom contact fields with `{{contact.custom_field_name}}`
- **Custom Values:** Access custom company values with `{{company.custom_value_name}}`
- **Case:** Keep field names lowercase with underscores
- **Instant preview:** Once you type the tag and click Save, it appears in the Agent Context panel

---

### Adding Variables Mid-Build

<Steps>
  <Step title="Insert the Tag">
    Type `{{contact.field_name}}` or `{{company.field_name}}` anywhere in your prompt or first message
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Reload">
    Click Save. New fields appear under Agent Context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Sample Values">
    Fill in test values to preview how the agent will sound
  </Step>
  <Step title="Populate in Workflow">
    For outbound calls/chats, supply the live values when configuring the action in your automation
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Outbound vs Inbound

**Outbound Calls/Chats:**  
Dynamic variables work immediately. Supply contact values when you configure the outbound action in your workflow. Company variables are automatically available.

**Inbound Calls/Chats:**  
Contact variables won't populate automatically. Instead:

1. Trigger a **Find or Create Contact** tool at the start of the conversation
2. Pass returned details into the prompt
3. Create a new contact on the fly if none exists

Company variables are always available for both inbound and outbound conversations.

<Note>
  For inbound conversations, you'll need to fetch contact data from your CRM first
  before contact variables can be populated. Company variables work immediately.
</Note>

---

## Markdown Formatting

Writing a single block of text works—but wrapping your prompt in Markdown makes every section clearer for you and the AI model. Better structure means faster, more accurate answers.

### Example Structure (Snippet)

Here's what a well-structured prompt looks like:

```markdown
# Role & Objective

You are the inbound receptionist for Elite Fitness, Perth, Australia.
Your goal is to book free trial appointments for prospective members.

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Greeting

"Hi! Thanks for reaching out to Elite Fitness. How can I help you today?"

### 2. Discovery

Ask about their fitness goals and preferred workout times.

### 3. Pitch

"Based on what you've told me, I think you'd love our [SPECIFIC PROGRAM]."

### 4. Close

"I can get you booked in for a free trial this week.
Does Tuesday or Thursday work better?"

## FAQs

**Q:** What time do you open?  
**A:** We're open 5am – 9pm Monday–Friday, 7am – 5pm Saturday.

**Q:** Do I need to bring anything?  
**A:** Just comfortable workout clothes and a water bottle!

## Conditional Logic

**If** caller only wants pricing:

- Provide the basic price
- Emphasize value ("That includes unlimited classes...")
- Offer a free trial

**Else if** caller asks about a specific program:

- Explain that program's benefits
- Mention success stories
- Book them in
```

The model now sees clear blocks—no hunting for information.

---

### Voice-Specific Caveat (11 Labs and Similar)

<Warning>
  When the sentence is inside quotes—the part the agent will actually
  speak—leave out bold or italic markers.
</Warning>

Otherwise the speech engine may:

- Drop the formatted words altogether, **or**
- Read out the asterisks ("asterisk Outbox AI asterisk")

**Bad:**

```markdown
"Thanks for calling **Elite Fitness**!"
```

**Good:**

```markdown
**Agent should say:**  
"Thanks for calling Elite Fitness!"
```

Keep formatting outside quoted dialogue and you'll avoid those glitches.

---

### Quick Automation Tip

Pressed for time? Paste your plain prompt into ChatGPT (GPT-4o or Claude) and say:

> "Convert this text into Markdown. Do not bold any words that appear inside quotation marks or use any tables."

Then check the output in [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) before pasting it into Outbox AI.

---

1. **Find:** `\{\{gym_name\}\}` → **Replace:** "Elite Fitness"
2. **Find:** `\{\{gym_address\}\}` → **Replace:** "123 Fitness St, Perth"
3. **Find:** `\{\{gym_phone\}\}` → **Replace:** "(08) 1234 5678"

Done in seconds instead of hunting through the document manually!

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Save your template with placeholder variables (like `

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ Too Vague" icon="question">
    **Bad:** "Be helpful and answer questions."
    
    **Good:** "You are a customer service agent for ABC Company. Your goal is to resolve customer issues within the first interaction. Always confirm the issue is resolved before ending the call."
    
    Specificity creates consistency.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="❌ Too Rigid" icon="lock">
  **Bad:** "Follow this script exactly, word for word." **Good:** "Use this
  script as a guide. Adapt your phrasing to match the caller's style, but always
  hit these key points: [list]." Flexibility sounds more human.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="❌ Forgetting Edge Cases" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  **Missing:** What if they don't want to book? What if they hung up by
  accident? What if they're angry? **Include:** "If the caller is upset,
  acknowledge their frustration first. 'I understand that's frustrating. Let's
  sort this out together.'" Cover the unhappy paths.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="❌ Overly Complex Formatting" icon="code">
  **Bad:** Tables, nested lists, excessive bolding in spoken dialogue **Good:**
  Simple Markdown, clear sections, formatting only for structure (not in quotes)
  Simple = reliable.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ Ignoring Feedback" icon="ear-deaf">
    **Bad:** Writing a prompt and never updating it
    
    **Good:** Reviewing conversation logs weekly, noting repeated issues, and refining the prompt
    
    Your first version will never be your best version.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Sounds Robotic" icon="robot">
    **Problem:** Responses feel stiff and unnatural.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add more conversational filler words ("um," "ah," "let me check")
    - Use contractions ("I'm," "we're," "that's")
    - Include friendly phrases ("no worries," "sounds good," "awesome!")
    - Test with a more casual tone setting
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Agent Ignoring Instructions" icon="ban">
  **Problem:** The agent isn't following key parts of your prompt.
  **Solutions:** - Move critical instructions to the top of the prompt - Use
  bold headings for important sections - Repeat key rules in multiple sections
  if necessary - Simplify complex conditional logic - Use the Generate button to
  restructure
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Agent Rambling" icon="comment-dots">
  **Problem:** Responses are too long and lose the caller. **Solutions:** - Add
  to Response Style Guidelines: "Keep answers under 2-3 sentences" - Explicitly
  say: "Ask ONE question at a time, then wait" - Include examples of concise
  responses in your script
</Accordion>

{" "}

  <Accordion title="Variables Not Populating" icon="brackets-curly">
    **Problem:** Dynamic variables show as `{{ contact.first_name }}` instead of actual
    values. **Solutions:** 
    - Check syntax: must use structured format `{{contact.field_name}}` or `{{company.field_name}}`
    - Ensure you're using the correct category (`contact.` or `company.`)
    - For custom fields/values, verify they exist in Company Settings
    - For inbound calls/chats, add a Find or Create Contact tool first
    - For outbound calls/chats, verify contact values are passed in the workflow
    - Company variables should work automatically - if not, check Company Settings
    - Save and reload to see new variables in Agent Context
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Markdown Not Rendering" icon="file-code">
    **Problem:** Your formatting looks broken in the agent's responses.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Remove formatting (bold/italic) from inside quoted dialogue
    - Ensure blank lines between sections
    - Test in Markdown Live Preview first
    - Keep formatting simple (headings, bullets, quotes only)
  </Accordion>
