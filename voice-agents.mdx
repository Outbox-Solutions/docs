## Overview

Voice agents are the powerhouse of Outbox AI—perfect for outbound dialing, lead qualification, appointment booking, and more. They do have a steeper learning curve than chat agents, so use this guide as your reference while you build.

</Note>

## Prompt Settings

The foundation of your voice agent starts with two key fields.

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Core Prompt Settings"
  />
</Frame>

### Prompt

Paste your full prompt here. This is the brain of your voice agent—it defines personality, objectives, and how to handle different scenarios.

**Important Considerations:**

- ⚠️ **Words will be spoken aloud** – Avoid complex symbols, unusual punctuation, or hard-to-pronounce terms
- 🗣️ **Write for speech** – Use "twenty-five" instead of "25" for natural-sounding responses
- 📝 **Keep it conversational** – The agent should sound human, not like it's reading a script

<Tip>
  Use the **Generate** button to let AI help you create or refine your prompt!
  See our [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide) for detailed instructions.
</Tip>

### First Message

Control how the agent opens the conversation.

**For Inbound Calls:**

Set a greeting so callers know who answered.

```
"Outbox AI, Jacob speaking—how can I help?"
```

```
"Thanks for calling Elite Fitness! This is Sarah. What can I do for you today?"
```

**For Outbound Calls:**

Create a personalized opening that gets attention.

```
"Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is Sarah from Elite Fitness. I'm calling about your inquiry. Do you have a quick minute?"
```

**Leave Blank:**

If you want the agent to **wait for the caller to speak first** (common for inbound support lines).

</Tip>

---

### Model Selection

Choose the AI model that powers your agent's intelligence. Each model balances speed, reasoning ability, and cost differently.

---

### Pricing Model

Voice agents use a token-based pricing system:

- **Included Tokens:** Each model includes a certain number of tokens in your agent's prompt per minute
- **Overage Pricing:** Any tokens beyond the included limit are charged at a per-1000-tokens rate per minute

**How it works:**

- Your agent's prompt (including system instructions, tools, and context) consumes tokens
- Each model includes a different amount of tokens in the base price
- If your prompt exceeds the included token limit, you pay the overage rate for the additional tokens
- Pricing is calculated per minute of call time

<Tip>
  **Optimize Your Prompts:** Keep your prompts concise to stay within the
  included token limit. Longer prompts with extensive FAQs or tool
  configurations may incur overage charges.
</Tip>

  switching to a model with more included tokens (Mini/Nano variants) rather
  than paying overage fees.
</Tip>

---

### Model Configuration

Fine-tune your selected model's behavior with advanced configuration options.

**Temperature**  
Control the randomness and creativity of your agent's responses. Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic, while higher values allow for more varied responses.

**Max Tokens**  
Set the maximum length of responses generated by the model. Adjust this based on your use case—shorter for quick confirmations, longer for detailed explanations.

<Note>
  **Advanced Settings:** Temperature and Max Tokens can be configured in your
  agent's advanced settings. These settings allow you to fine-tune how your
  model responds to match your specific use case.
</Note>

---

### Voice Settings

Customize your selected voice with ElevenLabs' advanced voice parameters for precise control over speech generation.

**Model**

Choose the ElevenLabs voice model that best fits your needs:

- **Eleven Turbo v2** – Fast, high-quality voice synthesis
- **Eleven Turbo v2.5** – Enhanced version with improved speed and quality
- **Eleven Multilingual v1** – Supports multiple languages
- **Eleven Multilingual v2** – Updated multilingual model with enhanced language support
- **Eleven English v1** – Optimized for English language synthesis

**Stability**  
**Default: 0.45**

Increasing variability can make speech more expressive with output varying between re-generations. It can also lead to instabilities.

**Clarity + Similarity**  
**Default: 0.65**

Low values are recommended if background artifacts are present in generated speech.

**Speed**  
**Default: 1.00**

Controls the speed of speech generation.

**Style Exaggeration**  
**Default: 0.00**

High values are recommended if the style of the speech should be exaggerated compared to the uploaded audio. Higher values can lead to more instability. Setting this to 0.0 will greatly increase generation speed.

**Optimize Streaming Latency**  
**Default: 1**

Controls streaming latency optimization level (0-4).

**Use Speaker Boost**  
Boost the similarity of the synthesized speech and the voice at the cost of some generation speed.

**Auto Mode**  
Reduces latency for complete sentences but may affect quality with partial phrases.

<Tip>
  **Fine-tuning Tips:** Start with default values and adjust one parameter at a
  time to see how it affects your voice output. Small adjustments can make
  significant differences in how natural and expressive your agent sounds.
</Tip>

## Knowledge Base

Give your agent access to company information, product details, policies, and more. Choose from three methods:

<Warning>
  **Performance Impact:** Knowledge base lookups add **2-4 seconds of latency**
  per query during calls. Best reserved for inbound reception, help-desk
  scenarios, or when accuracy matters more than speed. For fast-paced outbound
  calls, put FAQs directly in your prompt instead.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Upload" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Drop files directly into the knowledge base—the agent will read and understand them.

    **Supported Formats:**
    - 📄 PDFs
    - 📝 Word documents (.docx, .doc)
    - 📊 CSV files
    - 📋 Plain-text files (.txt)
    - 🔤 Markdown files (.md)

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/chat-knowledge-file-upload.png" alt="File Upload" />
    </Frame>

    **Best for:**
    - Product manuals
    - Company policies
    - FAQs
    - Pricing sheets
    - Training materials

  </Accordion>

## Advanced Settings

Fine-tune your agent's behavior with these powerful configuration options.

### Time Zone

**Essential for accurate appointment booking.**

Set the agent's time zone so it can correctly interpret phrases like "tomorrow at 3pm" or "next Monday morning."

<Note>
  **Critical for booking tools:** Without the correct time zone, appointments
  may be scheduled for the wrong time, causing missed meetings and frustrated
  customers.
</Note>

---

### HIPAA Compliance

**Stop call logs and recordings from being stored.**

When **HIPAA Compliance** is enabled:

- ❌ No call recordings are stored
- ❌ No transcriptions are saved
- ❌ No logs are kept
- ✅ Only basic call metadata (duration, status) is retained

**When to Enable:**

- Healthcare providers
- Legal firms
- Financial services
- Any regulated industry requiring data protection

<Warning>
  **Trade-off:** With HIPAA mode enabled, you won't be able to review call
  recordings for training or quality assurance purposes.
</Warning>

---

### Forwarding Number

**Automatically pass a qualified caller to a live rep.**

Enter a phone number in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+61412345678`) to transfer calls.

**How It Works:**

1. Agent qualifies the lead during the call
2. Agent says: "Great! Let me connect you with one of our specialists."
3. Call is transferred to the forwarding number
4. Live rep picks up and continues the conversation

**Use Cases:**

- Hot leads ready to buy
- Technical questions beyond the agent's scope
- VIP customers requesting personal service
- Emergency or urgent situations

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Use conditional logic in your prompt to decide when to forward.
  For example: "If the caller wants to speak to someone immediately, forward the
  call. Otherwise, book an appointment."
</Tip>

---

### Key Terms

**Improve transcription accuracy for unusual names, brands, suburbs, etc.**

Add terms that the speech-to-text engine might misunderstand. Separate each term with a space.

**Examples:**

```
Outbox Mandurah Fremantle Joondalup CrossFit Pilates HIIT
```

**What to Add:**

- Business names (especially unique spellings)
- Suburb and location names
- Product names and brands
- Industry-specific terminology
- Uncommon proper nouns

<Note>
  Key terms help the transcription engine recognize these words correctly during
  the call, leading to better comprehension and fewer errors.
</Note>

---

### Voicemail Message

**What to say if the system detects voicemail after ~20 seconds.**

**Example:**

```
"Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is Sarah from Elite Fitness. I was just calling to follow up on your inquiry about our membership. Give us a call back at 08 1234 5678, or I'll try you again later. Have a great day!"
```

**Best Practices:**

- ✅ Keep it under 15 seconds
- ✅ Include your callback number
- ✅ Give a reason for the call
- ✅ Sound natural and friendly
- ❌ Don't oversell or sound desperate

<Tip>
  **Leave it blank** if you don't want the agent to leave voicemails. The call
  will simply end and be logged as "no answer."
</Tip>

---

### End Call Message

**Last line before hanging up.**

**Examples:**

```
"Thanks for your time today! You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Have a great day!"
```

```
"Perfect! We'll see you on Tuesday at 3pm. Looking forward to it!"
```

```
"No worries at all. Feel free to call us back if you change your mind. Take care!"
```

**Leave Blank:**

If you want the agent to **disconnect silently** after completing its objective.

---

### Unqualified Prompt

**Define disqualifying criteria so calls are automatically tagged "Unqualified."**

**Example:**

```
Mark the call as unqualified if any of the following are true:
- The caller is a renter (we only work with homeowners)
- The caller is over 75 years old
- The caller is not the decision-maker
- The property is commercial (we only do residential)
```

**Why Use This:**

Unqualified tags integrate with GoHighLevel automations, allowing you to:

- Automatically remove unqualified leads from sequences
- Trigger different follow-up workflows
- Tag contacts for future remarketing
- Keep your pipeline clean and focused

<Tip>
  Be specific! Vague criteria lead to inconsistent tagging. Clear rules ensure
  reliable automation.
</Tip>

---

### Summary Prompt

**Tell Outbox AI how to format the call summary posted back to your CRM.**

**Example:**

```
Summarize this call in 2-3 sentences. Include:
- The caller's main question or goal
- Whether an appointment was booked (and when)
- Any objections or concerns mentioned
- Next steps

Format it in plain English, suitable for a sales rep to read quickly.
```

**Default Behavior:**

If left blank, Outbox AI generates a standard summary automatically.

**Customization Ideas:**

- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Include specific fields for your CRM
- Highlight key selling points mentioned
- Note urgency level or buying intent

---

### Scoring Prompt

**Define how the call should be scored from 0-100.**

**Example:**

```
Rate how successful this call was from 0-100. 0 means a true failure: caller was upset/angry, tools malfunctioned, or a serious error occurred.
100 means a perfect outcome: caller was engaged, happy, and all tools worked correctly.
50 means a neutral/middle call where some interaction happened but nothing notable was achieved.
If the call was very short (1-5 seconds), unanswered, or had no meaningful interaction, do NOT score it as 0. Instead, treat it as a neutral/no-outcome call (e.g., 30-40).
Consider caller engagement, tool success, and overall outcome when assigning the score.
```

**How to Use Scores:**

- Route high-scoring leads to sales immediately
- Add low-scoring leads to nurture campaigns
- Track conversion rates by score range
- Optimize agent performance over time

<Note>
  Scores are returned with the call completion webhook and visible in
  GoHighLevel custom fields.
</Note>

---

### Webhook URL

**Where to send the end-of-call report.**

Enter a URL to receive a POST request with detailed call information immediately after each call completes.

**Request Format:**

The webhook sends a POST request with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "id": "thread-uuid",
  "status": "did-succeed",
  "summary": "Caller wanted to book an appointment for teeth cleaning. Successfully scheduled for Tuesday at 3pm. Caller was friendly and confirmed contact details.",

- Trigger follow-up automations based on status
- Log analytics in custom dashboards
- Route hot leads to sales teams
- Create tasks for follow-ups

<Tip>
  Test your webhook with a tool like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to see
  exactly what data is being sent before connecting your production systems.
</Tip>

---

### Recording Consent Message

**What to tell the user if you're recording the call.**

**Example:**

```
"Just so you know, this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes."
```

<Warning>
  **Legal Requirement:** Many jurisdictions require consent before recording
  calls. Check your local regulations and always inform callers if recording is
  enabled.
</Warning>

---

### Log to CRM

**Log the recording and transcript of these calls into your CRM.**

When enabled:

- ✅ Full transcript is added to the contact record in GoHighLevel
- ✅ Audio recording link is attached
- ✅ Call summary appears in the timeline
- ✅ Score and status are logged

**Disable When:**

- HIPAA compliance is required
- Calls are purely transactional (confirmations, reminders)
- You're doing high-volume testing

---

---

### Call Queue

**Overflow when concurrency is maxed, scheduled callbacks, or when wallet credit is low.**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/voice-call-queue.png" alt="Call Queue" />
</Frame>

**Calls Enter the Queue When:**

- ⏳ All concurrent call slots are full
- 📅 Call is scheduled for a future time (callbacks)
- 💳 Wallet balance is too low to place the call
- 🔄 Retry attempts are pending

**Queue Management:**

- ▶️ **Resume** – Process queued calls immediately
- ⏸️ **Pause** – Hold calls in queue without processing
- ❌ **Cancel** – Remove calls from queue entirely

**Monitoring:**

- See how many calls are waiting
- Identify why calls are queued
- Prioritize urgent callbacks
- Top up credits if needed

<Warning>
  **High Queue = Problem:** If your queue is consistently full, you need to
  either: - Increase your concurrent call limit - Add more wallet credits - Slow
  down your outbound campaigns
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with GPT-4.1" icon="star">
    Don't overthink model selection. GPT-4.1 handles 95% of use cases perfectly. Only upgrade if you encounter specific limitations.
    
    **Token Considerations:**
    - If your prompt is longer than ~1,500 tokens, consider GPT-4.1 Mini (7,500 included tokens) or GPT-4.1 Nano (30,000 included tokens) to avoid overage charges
    - For very complex agents with extensive prompts, many tools, or large knowledge bases, GPT-5 Mini or GPT-5 Nano offer generous token allocations
    - Monitor your token usage and switch models if you're frequently hitting overage charges
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Voice Quality First" icon="headphones">
  Before writing a complex prompt, test the voice itself:
  
  1. Create a simple "Hello, this is a test" agent
  2. Call yourself
  3. Evaluate clarity, tone, and professionalism
  4. Try 2-3 different voices
  5. Pick the winner, then build your prompt
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep First Messages Short" icon="message">
    The first 3 seconds determine whether someone hangs up or engages:
    
    ✅ Good: "Hi Sarah, this is Jake from Elite Fitness. Quick question about your inquiry—got a minute?"
    
    ❌ Bad: "Hello! Thank you so much for your interest in Elite Fitness. My name is Jake and I'm calling today to follow up on the form you submitted on our website about our premium membership packages..."
    
    Get to the point fast.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Key Terms Liberally" icon="key">
  If you're getting transcription errors (wrong suburb names, mangled product
  names), don't hesitate to add 20-30 key terms. It makes a huge difference.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Latency" icon="gauge">
    If your agent feels "laggy":
    
    - Remove knowledge base (adds 2-4s per query)
    - Switch to a faster model (GPT-5 models → GPT-4.1 or GPT-4.1 Mini/Nano)
    - Simplify tool complexity
    - Shorten your prompt to reduce token processing time
    
    Speed matters in voice. Aim for under 1.5 second response times.
    
    **Note:** If you need to shorten your prompt due to latency, consider switching to a model with more included tokens (like GPT-4.1 Mini/Nano) rather than cutting important content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Conversations Weekly" icon="calendar">
    Listen to 5-10 calls every week:
    
    - What objections keep coming up?
    - Where does the agent get confused?
    - What questions can't it answer?
    - Where do people hang up?
    
    Update your prompt based on real patterns, not assumptions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Sounds Robotic" icon="robot">
    **Problem:** The voice feels unnatural or scripted.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Enable **Background Sound** (Office or Lounge)
    - Add filler words to your prompt ("um," "ah," "let me check")
    - Use contractions ("I'm" not "I am," "we're" not "we are")
    - Test a different voice with more personality
    - Avoid overly formal language in your prompt
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Poor Call Quality" icon="phone-slash">
    **Problem:** Audio is choppy, quiet, or unclear.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Test a different voice provider
    - Disable background sound if volume is low
    - Check that the caller's connection is stable
    - Verify you're not exceeding concurrent call limits
    - Contact support if issue persists across multiple calls
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Taking Too Long to Respond" icon="clock">
    **Problem:** Long pauses between responses (over 3 seconds).
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Disable knowledge base if enabled
    - Switch to a faster model (GPT-5 models → GPT-4.1 or GPT-4.1 Mini/Nano)
    - Simplify tool logic and reduce API calls
    - Shorten your prompt to reduce token processing time
    - Remove complex conditional logic
    
    **Token Optimization:** If shortening your prompt reduces functionality, consider switching to GPT-4.1 Mini or GPT-4.1 Nano which have more included tokens and faster response times.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tools Not Triggering" icon="wrench">
    **Problem:** The agent isn't using the tools you've configured.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Make tool usage **explicit** in your prompt: "When the caller wants to book, use the book_appointment tool"
    - Test the tool manually to ensure it's working
    - Check API keys and authentication
    - Review tool logs for error messages
    - Simplify the tool trigger conditions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transcription Errors" icon="closed-captioning">
    **Problem:** Names, locations, or terms are misheard.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add problematic words to **Key Terms**
    - Use phonetic spelling if needed (e.g., "Mandjoogoordap" for "Mandogalup")
    - Test in a quiet environment first
    - Ensure the caller speaks clearly
    - Switch to a model with better transcription (GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1 Chat Latest, or ChatGPT-4o Latest)
    
    **Note:** GPT-5 models generally have better transcription accuracy, but consider token costs when upgrading.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Calls Going to Queue" icon="list">
  **Problem:** Calls aren't being placed immediately. **Solutions:** - Check
  your **wallet balance** – top up if low - Verify you haven't hit your
  **concurrent call limit** - Review scheduled callback times - Resume the queue
  if it's paused - Contact support to increase limits if needed
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Token Overage Charges" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Problem:** You're frequently paying overage charges for tokens beyond the included limit.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - **Switch to a model with more included tokens:** If you're using GPT-4.1 (1,500 tokens), consider GPT-4.1 Mini (7,500 tokens) or GPT-4.1 Nano (30,000 tokens)
    - **For complex agents:** Use GPT-5 Mini (16,000 tokens) or GPT-5 Nano (75,000 tokens) for agents with extensive prompts, many tools, or large knowledge bases
    - **Optimize your prompt:** Remove unnecessary content, consolidate FAQs, simplify tool descriptions
    - **Review your prompt length:** Check how many tokens your prompt consumes and compare to your model's included token limit
    - **Monitor usage:** Track which agents are hitting overage charges most frequently
    
    **Cost Comparison Example:**
    - GPT-4.1: 1,500 included tokens, $2.00 per 1K overage
    - GPT-4.1 Nano: 30,000 included tokens, $0.10 per 1K overage
    
    If your prompt is 5,000 tokens, GPT-4.1 Nano would be significantly more cost-effective than paying overage on GPT-4.1.
