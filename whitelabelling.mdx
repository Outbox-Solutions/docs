## Overview

White-label Outbox AI to present the platform as your own product. Replace logos, brand names, domains, and email addresses so clients only see your agency's branding.

<Tip>
  **Perfect for agencies:** Build your brand while using Outbox AI's
  infrastructure behind the scenes.

## Configure Your Branding

Set up your agency's branding in four key fields.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/whitelabel-settings-card.png" alt="White-label Settings" />
</Frame>

### 1. Logo

Upload your agency logo (PNG or SVG, square, 512×512px minimum).

**Where it appears:**

- Sidebar navigation
- Login screen
- Email invitations
- Browser favicon

---

### 2. Brand Name

Enter your agency or product name.

**Where it appears:**

- Browser tab title
- Login screen heading
- Email subject lines
- Platform footer

**Example:** "Acme Marketing Platform", "Digital Solutions Hub"

---

### 3. Custom Domain

Enter your custom domain (e.g., `portal.youragency.com`).

**How it works:**

1. Enter your subdomain (e.g., `app` or `portal`)
2. Outbox AI provides 3 DNS records to add
3. Add these records at your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)
4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 1-2 hours)
5. Your portal becomes accessible at your custom domain

**Example DNS Records:**

If you enter `app.youragency.com`, you'll add these records:

| Type  | Name      | Value                   |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| CNAME | `app`     | `cname.vercel-dns.com`  |
| CNAME | `www.app` | `cname.vercel-dns.com`  |
| TXT   | `_vercel` | `[vercel_verification]` |

<Note>
  **Use a subdomain:** `portal.youragency.com` or `app.youragency.com` works
  best. Avoid using your root domain. The exact TXT verification value will be
  unique to your account.
</Note>

---

### 4. Email Address

Set your sender email for system notifications and invites (e.g., `noreply@youragency.com`).

**Requirements:**

1. **Connect SendGrid** – Add your SendGrid API key
2. **Verify sender email** – SendGrid will send a verification link
3. **Set as default** – Choose this email for all notifications

<Warning>
  **SendGrid required:** You need a SendGrid account to send emails from your
  domain. Sign up at [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) if you don't have one.
</Warning>

**Common email addresses:**

- `noreply@youragency.com` – Automated notifications
- `support@youragency.com` – Support emails
- `team@youragency.com` – Team invites

## White-Label GoHighLevel

If you run a white-label GoHighLevel instance, you can replace GoHighLevel branding throughout Outbox AI.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/whitelabel-ghl-card.png" alt="GoHighLevel White-label" />
</Frame>

### What to Configure

**1. GoHighLevel Logo**  
Upload your white-labeled GHL logo (square PNG/SVG, 256×256px minimum)

**2. GoHighLevel Account Name**  
Enter your GHL white-label name (e.g., "Acme CRM" instead of "GoHighLevel")

### What Gets Replaced

✅ All "GoHighLevel" text becomes your brand name  
✅ GoHighLevel logo replaced with your logo  
✅ Integration cards show your branding  
✅ Settings and help text reference your CRM name

**Example:**

| Before                    | After                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| "Connect to GoHighLevel"  | "Connect to Acme CRM"  |
| GoHighLevel logo          | Your CRM logo          |
| "GoHighLevel Integration" | "Acme CRM Integration" |

<Note>
  This only affects **display** in Outbox AI. Your actual GoHighLevel
  white-label setup remains unchanged.
</Note>

---

## Testing Your Setup

After configuring your white-label settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Your Custom Domain">
    Open your custom domain in an incognito/private window
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Login Screen">Verify your logo and brand name appear</Step>
  <Step title="Send Test Invite">
    Invite a test email and confirm it shows your branding
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review All Pages">
    Log in and verify no "Outbox AI" branding is visible
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Use incognito mode** to see exactly what clients see without your cached
  login session.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain Not Loading" icon="globe">

    - Verify DNS has propagated using [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org)
    - Wait up to 48 hours for full propagation
    - Contact support if still not working after 48 hours
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Emails Not Sending" icon="envelope">
  **Problem:** Invites or notifications aren't being received. **Solutions:** -

  sending an email directly from SendGrid dashboard - Set up SPF/DKIM records
  for better deliverability

  scaling - Ensure transparent background for dark/light mode compatibility
