## Billing & Usage

Track usage and profitability for each company account.

### Usage Dashboard

View detailed metrics for each subaccount:

- **Cost** – How much the usage cost your agency
- **Revenue** – How much you charged the client
- **Profit** – Your margin (Revenue - Cost)

This gives you full visibility into which clients are most profitable and helps with pricing optimization.

## Advanced Rebilling Settings

Configure automated billing rules for each company account.

</Frame>

### Rebill Option

Toggle rebilling on or off for the company. When off, you'll need to bill the client manually.

### Retainer Fee (Optional)

```
Retainer Fee: $0.00 USD/month
```

Set a fixed monthly fee that will be charged to this company each month, regardless of usage.

### Chat Multiplier

```
Chat Multiplier: 1.0x
```

Multiplier applied to the cost of each chat message response. For example:

- `1.0` = Pass through cost at 0% markup
- `1.5` = 50% markup on chat costs
- `2.0` = 100% markup on chat costs

### Call Rate (per minute)

```
Call Rate: $0.16/min
```

The rate charged to your client per call minute (excluding VOIP provider costs). This is your margin on voice calls.

### Agent Limit (Optional)

```
Agent Limit: Unlimited
```

Set the maximum number of agents this company can create. Leave empty for unlimited agents.

### Concurrent Lanes

```
Concurrent Lanes: 10 (Max: 25)
```

Control how many simultaneous calls the client can handle at once. This prevents resource abuse and helps manage infrastructure costs.

## Rebilling Options

Choose how you want to collect payment from your clients.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Off">
    Rebilling is disabled. You'll need to invoice clients manually through your
    own system.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="GHL Wallet">
  Automatically charge the client's GoHighLevel Wallet balance.
  <Warning>
    Only available if you own **GoHighLevel Agency-Pro** with Rebilling enabled.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Draft">
  Generate an invoice draft that you can review before sending to the client.
  **Best for:** Agencies that want to review invoices before they go out.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Invoice">
  E-mail a final invoice automatically. The client pays manually via Stripe's
  payment link. **Best for:** Clients who prefer to review and pay invoices
  manually.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe Charge">
  Automatically charge the stored card on the 1st of each month. **Best for:**
  Fully automated billing with reliable clients.

    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set competitive but profitable rates">
    Research market rates for AI voice and chat agents. A typical markup is
    50-100% on infrastructure costs, but you can charge more based on the value
    you provide (custom integrations, dedicated support, etc.).
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Use retainer fees for predictable revenue">
  If you're providing ongoing support or maintenance, add a retainer fee. This
  creates predictable MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) for your agency.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Start with Stripe Draft for new clients">
  When onboarding new clients, use Stripe Draft mode so you can review usage and
  costs before sending the first invoice. Once you're comfortable with their
  usage patterns, switch to automatic charging.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set concurrent lane limits appropriately">
    Don't give unlimited concurrent lanes unless the client has committed to
    high-volume usage. Most small businesses need 3-5 lanes, while call centers
    might need 10-25.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client isn't receiving invitation emails">
    - Check that the email address is correct - Ask them to check spam/junk
    folders - Try resending the invitation - Verify your email service isn't
    blocking outbound mail
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Stripe charges are failing">
  - Ensure the client has a valid payment method on file - Check if their card
  has expired - Verify the card has sufficient funds/credit available - Consider
  switching to Stripe Invoice mode for manual payment
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Usage costs seem incorrect">
    - Check the date range you're viewing - Verify the call duration calculation
    (some providers round up) - Review the chat message count and token usage -
    Ensure your multipliers and rates are set correctly
  </Accordion>
