## Custom Actions & Triggers

Outbox AI provides powerful custom actions that you can use directly within your GoHighLevel workflows. These actions enable you to automate conversations, make phone calls, and trigger AI modules seamlessly.

### Chat Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activate AI Chat Agent" icon="comment-dots">
    Activate an AI chat agent to automatically respond to contacts across multiple platforms.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **Choose the agent** from the dropdown menu
    2. **Tick the platforms** it should answer on (can be one or many: SMS, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.)
    3. **Optional:** Set a minimum and maximum reply delay (e.g., twenty to forty seconds) to mimic human typing patterns

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-activate-chat-agent.png" alt="Activate AI Chat Agent" />
    </Frame>

    **How it works:**

    When the contact reaches this workflow step, the AI agent takes over the conversation from that point forward. You can follow up with scheduled SMS or email reminders; the agent will only jump in after the prospect responds.

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Use reply delays to make conversations feel more natural and human-like. A 20-40 second delay gives contacts time to read and respond without feeling rushed.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Interrupt AI Chat Agent" icon="hand">
    Stop an active AI chat agent and return the conversation to human control.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **Select the agent** (or agents) you want to silence
    2. Once this action runs, the thread is returned to human control

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-interrupt-chat-agent.png" alt="Interrupt AI Chat Agent" />
    </Frame>

    **When to use:**

    - Contact requests to speak with a human
    - AI agent encounters a complex scenario requiring human intervention
    - Contact becomes frustrated or asks to be removed
    - Conversation needs to be escalated to sales or support

    <Note>
      After interruption, no further AI messages will be sent on that platform for that contact unless you reactivate the agent.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Query AI Chat Agent" icon="message-question">
    Ask an AI agent a specific question with custom context, useful for automating responses outside of active conversations.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **Choose an agent** from the dropdown
    2. **Insert context** – provide background information the agent needs
    3. **Add the message** to ask the agent

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-query-chat-agent.png" alt="Query AI Chat Agent" />
    </Frame>

    **Use Cases:**

    - **Automate Instagram comment responses** – Ask the agent to craft a reply based on the comment content
    - **Generate personalized follow-ups** – Query the agent for a custom message based on contact behavior
    - **Create dynamic content** – Use the agent to generate tailored responses for specific scenarios
    - **Sentiment analysis** – Ask the agent to evaluate a contact's message and route accordingly

    <Tip>
      The response from the agent can be stored in a custom field and used later in your workflow!
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Voice Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send AI Call" icon="phone">
    Automatically place outbound AI phone calls to contacts using your voice agents.

    **Configuration:**

    1. **Agent** – Select your speed-to-lead voice agent
    2. **From Number** – Choose your dedicated dialler DID (Direct Inward Dialing number)
    3. **First Message** – Set the opening line for the call

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-send-ai-call.png" alt="Send AI Call" />
    </Frame>

    **Example First Message:**
    ```
    Hey, is this {{contact.first_name}}?
    ```

    **Context Variables:**

    You can pass dynamic variables from GoHighLevel to personalize each call:

    ```
    first_name = {{contact.first_name}}
    last_name = {{contact.last_name}}
    time_zone = {{contact.time_zone}}
    company_name = {{contact.company_name}}
    appointment_time = {{custom_values.appointment_time}}
    ```

    <Note>
      **Custom Variables:** List all the dynamic variables you have in your prompt so they can be properly substituted during the call.
    </Note>

    **When to use:**

    - **Speed-to-lead calls** – Instantly call new leads within seconds of form submission
    - **Appointment confirmations** – Automatically confirm bookings 24 hours in advance
    - **Follow-up calls** – Re-engage cold leads or no-shows
    - **Lead qualification** – Screen leads before passing them to your sales team

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Call Status" icon="phone-volume">
    Check the status of the most recent AI call sent to a contact.

    **Status Values:**

    - **did-succeed** – At least one success-flagged tool ran (e.g., booking confirmed, information collected)
    - **did-forward** – Call was forwarded to another number or agent
    - **did-not-answer** – Went to voicemail or contact didn't pick up
    - **did-not-qualify** – Contact hit an unqualified rule during the call
    - **customer-ended** – Caller hung up without completing desired action
    - **agent-ended** – AI agent ended the call (typically after completion)
    - **callback-booked** – Contact successfully scheduled a callback
    - **error** – Technical failure (malformed number, insufficient funds, carrier block, etc.)
    - **active** – Call is still in progress (rare, typically only seen in real-time webhooks)

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-check-call-status.png" alt="Check Call Status" />
    </Frame>

    **Use Cases:**

    - **Conditional routing** – Branch workflows based on specific outcomes
    - **Follow-up sequences** – Send SMS if `did-not-answer`, email if `customer-ended`
    - **Success tracking** – Tag contacts when `did-succeed` or `callback-booked`
    - **Error handling** – Alert team when `error` status is returned
    - **Lead scoring** – Award points for `did-succeed`, deduct for `did-not-qualify`

    <Tip>
      Use this action with IF/ELSE branches in your workflow to handle different call outcomes automatically. The status values are designed to be human-readable and easy to filter on.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cancel Scheduled Calls" icon="phone-slash">
    Cancel all queued or scheduled AI calls for a contact.

    **When to use:**

    - Contact responds before the scheduled call
    - Contact books an appointment and no longer needs a follow-up call
    - Contact requests not to be called
    - Lead becomes disqualified and should be removed from call sequences

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ghl-cancel-calls.png" alt="Cancel Scheduled Calls" />
    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      This action cancels **all** pending calls for the contact. If you only want to cancel specific calls, use conditional logic in your workflow.
    </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Triggers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI Call Completed" icon="bell">
    Trigger workflows automatically when an AI call completes, with powerful filtering and detailed call data.

## Troubleshooting

Having issues with your integration? Here are common problems and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ Invalid API Key Error">
    **Problem:** You're seeing an "Invalid key" error message.
    
    **Solution:** Double-check that you copied the Outbox **Company-level** API key, not the GoHighLevel account's API key. These are two different credentials—you need the one from Outbox AI's Company settings.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="🔒 Permissions Error">
  **Problem:** Authorization fails or you see a permissions error. **Solution:**
  Make sure you're logged into the correct GHL sub-account before authorizing.
  The permissions need to be granted by an admin user with sufficient access
  rights in GoHighLevel.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="🏢 Multiple Companies Setup">
  **Problem:** You manage multiple GoHighLevel instances or client accounts.
  **Solution:** You'll need to repeat the integration steps for each client
  separately. Every GoHighLevel instance requires its own connection to Outbox
  AI. Navigate to each company context in Outbox AI and complete the
  authorization flow.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔌 Connection Dropped">
    **Problem:** The integration was working but now shows as disconnected.
    
    **Solution:** This can happen if API keys are regenerated or permissions are revoked in GoHighLevel. Simply reconnect by going back to Integrations and following the authorization flow again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Need help?** If you're still experiencing issues after trying these
  solutions, reach out to support with your account details and a description of
  the error you're seeing.
