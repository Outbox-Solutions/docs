## Overview

Chat agents handle every written channel—Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, web-chat widgets, SMS, WhatsApp, and email. This guide walks you through creating, configuring, and testing them so they feel every bit as polished as your voice agents.

---

## Create an Agent

### Step 1: Access Chat Agents

Navigate to the **Agents** tab in your Outbox AI dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-agents-dashboard.png" alt="Chat Agents Dashboard" />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Create New Agent

Click **New Agent** or open an existing one from the list.

    alt="Create New Chat Agent"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  **AI-Powered Prompt Generation:** If you enter a description of the agent in
  the "Create Agent" modal, Outbox AI will automatically generate a professional
  prompt for you!
</Tip>

---

## Write the Prompt

The prompt is the brain of your chat agent. In the large text box, you'll define how your agent behaves.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/voice-core-prompt-settings.png"
    alt="Chat Agent Prompt Editor"
  />
</Frame>

### What to Include:

1. **Agent's Role** – Who is the agent? (e.g., "You are a friendly customer service representative for XYZ Company")
2. **Tone & Personality** – Formal, casual, enthusiastic, empathetic, etc.
3. **Goals** – What should the agent accomplish? (qualify leads, book appointments, answer FAQs)
4. **Tool Usage Instructions** – Explicitly tell the agent when to use tools:

```
When a customer wants to book an appointment, call the book_appointment tool.
When you need to check inventory, use the check_stock tool.
```

<Note>
  **Don't forget to save!** Click the **Save** button to apply your changes.
  Once saved, the agent updates in real-time.
</Note>

---

## Attach Tools

Tools give your chat agent superpowers—the ability to book appointments, send data to external systems, fetch real-time information, and more.

## Platform Integrations

Toggle the channels your sub-account already has inside GoHighLevel. Your chat agent can handle conversations across all these platforms simultaneously.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat-platform-integrations.png"
    alt="Platform Integrations"
  />
</Frame>

### Available Channels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instagram DMs" icon="instagram">
    Automatically respond to Instagram direct messages
  </Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Facebook Messenger" icon="facebook-messenger">
  Handle Facebook Messenger conversations
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Email" icon="envelope">
  Respond to emails automatically
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="SMS" icon="message">
  Answer text messages instantly
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="WhatsApp" icon="whatsapp">
  Manage WhatsApp business conversations
</Card>

  <Card title="Web Chat" icon="comment-dots">
    Embed a chat widget on any website
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Important:** Switching a platform on means this agent will answer **all**
  new messages for that channel (unless a trigger blocks it—see next section).
</Warning>

---

## Triggers for Campaigns & Keyword Flows

Triggers give you precise control over when your agent should respond. Perfect for Instagram reels, keyword campaigns, or keeping the AI silent while you chat with clients manually.

### How Triggers Work:

1. **Add a trigger word or phrase** (e.g., "start", "book", "info")
2. The agent **only wakes up** when the incoming message matches the trigger
3. Messages that don't match the trigger are ignored by the AI

### Example Use Cases:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instagram Reel Campaigns" icon="video">
    "DM me **START** to claim your free voucher!"
    
    The agent only responds to messages containing "start", ignoring casual comments and other DMs.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Keyword-Based Routing" icon="route">
  - **"book"** → Activate booking agent - **"support"** → Activate support agent
  - **"refund"** → Activate refund agent
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manual Control" icon="hand">
    Set a trigger so the AI doesn't interfere when you're personally chatting with VIP clients.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Leave triggers **empty** if you want the agent to respond to every message on
  the enabled platforms.
</Tip>

---

## Delay Settings

Make your agent feel more human by adding natural response delays.

### Configuration:

- **Minimum delay** – The shortest time before the agent responds
- **Maximum delay** – The longest time before the agent responds
- The actual delay is **randomized** between these values

### Recommended Settings:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instant Response" icon="bolt">
    Min: 0 seconds Max: 5 seconds For time-sensitive inquiries or customer
    support
  </Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Human-like Response" icon="user">
  Min: 30 seconds Max: 120 seconds For conversations that should feel natural
  and unhurried
</Card>

{" "}

<Card title="Casual Response" icon="coffee">
  Min: 2 minutes Max: 10 minutes For lower-priority channels or when mimicking a
  busy human
</Card>

  <Card title="Business Hours Simulation" icon="clock">
    Min: 15 minutes Max: 60 minutes For email responses or non-urgent inquiries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Why randomize?** A fixed delay (e.g., always 60 seconds) feels robotic.
  Random delays make the agent feel more human and authentic.
</Note>

## Knowledge Base

Give your agent access to company information, product details, policies, and more. Choose from three methods:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Upload" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Drop files directly into the knowledge base—the agent will read and understand them.

    **Supported Formats:**
    - 📄 PDFs
    - 📝 Word documents (.docx, .doc)
    - 📊 CSV files
    - 📋 Plain-text files (.txt)
    - 🔤 Markdown files (.md)

    <Frame>

    - Product manuals
    - Company policies
    - FAQs
    - Pricing sheets
    - Training materials

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Website Scrape" icon="globe">

    </Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plain Text" icon="text">
    Paste raw text directly into the knowledge base.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/chat-knowledge-plain-text.png" alt="Plain Text" />
    </Frame>

    **Best for:**
    - Custom instructions

    - Testing and prototyping

    <Note>
      You can combine all three methods! Add files, scrape websites, **and** paste text for maximum coverage.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Agent Settings

Fine-tune your agent's behavior with advanced configuration options.

### Time Zone

Set the agent's time zone to ensure accurate date and appointment logic.

<Note>
  The time zone affects how the agent interprets phrases like "tomorrow at 3pm"
  or "next Monday."
</Note>

---

### Model Selection

Choose the AI model that powers your agent. Each model has different capabilities, speeds, and costs.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-settings-model.png" alt="Model Selection" />

</Warning>

---

## Embed Code

Get HTML code to embed your chat widget on any website—yours or your clients'.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/chat-embed-code.png" alt="Embed Code" />
</Frame>

### How to Use:

1. Copy the HTML snippet from the **Embed Code** section
2. Paste it into your website's HTML, just before the closing `</body>` tag
3. The chat widget will appear on your site automatically

### Example Code:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.getoutbox.ai/widget/chat.js"
  data-agent-id="6531f2d6-7067-458b-a782-2cae809a7dc6"
  data-open="false"
  async
></script>
```

<Note>
  Replace the `data-agent-id` value with your actual agent ID from the Embed
  Code section.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Customization:** You can style the chat widget using CSS to match your
  website's branding!
</Tip>

---

## Initial Message

Set the first message contacts see when they open the chat widget.

### Example Initial Messages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Friendly Greeting" icon="hand-wave">
    "👋 Hi there! How can I help you today?"
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Specific Offer" icon="gift">
  "🎉 Welcome! Ask me about our special promotion—20% off all services this
  week!"
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Lead Qualification" icon="clipboard-question">
  "Hi! I'm here to help you find the perfect solution. What brings you here
  today?"
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Booking Focus" icon="calendar-check">
    "Ready to book your appointment? I can check availability and get you scheduled in seconds!"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  The initial message only appears in the **web chat embed**. Other platforms
  (Instagram, SMS, etc.) don't support initial messages.
</Note>

---

## Interrupt Mode

Allow the agent to be interrupted when a message is manually sent to the contact.

### How It Works:

When **Interrupt Mode** is enabled:

1. ✅ The AI agent handles all conversations automatically
2. 👤 A human team member sends a manual message in GoHighLevel
3. 🛑 The AI agent is **immediately interrupted** for that contact
4. 🙋 The human takes over the conversation
5. 🤖 The AI stays silent unless manually reactivated

### When to Enable:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Enable Interrupt Mode" icon="toggle-on">
    **Best for most use cases:** - You want the flexibility to jump into
    conversations - VIP clients get personal attention - Complex situations need
    human expertise - Team members can take over seamlessly
  </Card>

  <Card title="Disable Interrupt Mode" icon="toggle-off">
    **When you want full automation:** - Fully automated support channels -
    After-hours emergency contacts - High-volume, low-touch scenarios - Testing
    agent performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Keep Interrupt Mode **enabled** during business hours so your
  team can step in when needed, but consider disabling it after hours for 24/7
  automation.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Expand" icon="seedling">
    1. Create a basic agent with one or two tools
    2. Test thoroughly on a single platform
    3. Add more platforms and tools gradually
    4. Monitor conversations and refine the prompt
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Be Specific in Your Prompt" icon="bullseye">
  Vague prompts create unpredictable agents. Instead of: ❌ "Be helpful and
  friendly" Try: ✅ "You are a customer service agent for ABC Company. Your goal
  is to help customers book appointments. Always be polite, confirm details
  before booking, and thank customers at the end of each conversation."
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Test Extensively Before Going Live" icon="flask">
  - Send test messages from different platforms - Try edge cases ("What if I say
  no?" "What if I'm confused?") - Have team members role-play difficult
  customers - Check that tools are working correctly
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="Monitor and Iterate" icon="chart-line">
  - Review conversation logs regularly - Look for patterns where the agent
  struggles - Update the prompt based on real conversations - Add knowledge base
  articles for common questions
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Delay Settings Wisely" icon="clock">
    **Different situations need different delays:**
    
    - ⚡ Instant (0-5s): Customer support, urgent inquiries
    - 👤 Human-like (30-120s): Sales conversations, lead nurturing
    - 📧 Relaxed (5-15m): Email responses, non-urgent channels
  </Accordion>
