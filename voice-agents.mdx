## Overview

Voice agents are the powerhouse of Outbox AI‚Äîperfect for outbound dialing, lead qualification, appointment booking, and more. They do have a steeper learning curve than chat agents, so use this guide as your reference while you build.

<Note>

  best practices on writing effective agent instructions.
</Note>

## Prompt Settings

The foundation of your voice agent starts with two key fields.

    alt="Core Prompt Settings"
  />
</Frame>

### Prompt

Paste your full prompt here. This is the brain of your voice agent‚Äîit defines personality, objectives, and how to handle different scenarios.

**Important Considerations:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Words will be spoken aloud** ‚Äì Avoid complex symbols, unusual punctuation, or hard-to-pronounce terms
- üó£Ô∏è **Write for speech** ‚Äì Use "twenty-five" instead of "25" for natural-sounding responses
- üìù **Keep it conversational** ‚Äì The agent should sound human, not like it's reading a script

<Tip>
  Use the **Generate** button to let AI help you create or refine your prompt!
  See our [Prompting Guide](/prompting-guide) for detailed instructions.
</Tip>

### First Message

Control how the agent opens the conversation.

**For Inbound Calls:**

Set a greeting so callers know who answered.

```
"Outbox AI, Jacob speaking‚Äîhow can I help?"
```

```
"Thanks for calling Elite Fitness! This is Sarah. What can I do for you today?"
```

**For Outbound Calls:**

Create a personalized opening that gets attention.

```
"Hi {{first_name}}, this is Sarah from Elite Fitness. I'm calling about your inquiry. Do you have a quick minute?"
```

**Leave Blank:**

If you want the agent to **wait for the caller to speak first** (common for inbound support lines).

  vs. intelligence, not cost!
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GPT-4.1 (Recommended)" icon="star">
    **770ms ‚Ä¢ Accurate ‚Ä¢ Moderate**

    The best balance of speed and intelligence for most use cases.

    - ‚ö° Fast enough for natural conversations
    - üß† Accurate reasoning and comprehension
    - ‚úÖ Handles most conversation flows smoothly
    - üéØ Reliable performance across scenarios

    **Best for:** Standard appointment booking, lead qualification, customer support, sales calls, FAQ handling

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GPT-4.1 Mini" icon="gauge-simple-max">
    **700ms ‚Ä¢ Moderate ‚Ä¢ Fast**

    Faster than GPT-4.1 but with slightly reduced intelligence.

    - üèÉ Quick response times
    - üí¨ Good for straightforward conversations
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è May struggle with complex scenarios

    **Best for:** Simple appointment confirmations, basic FAQs, predictable conversation flows

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GPT-4.1 Nano" icon="microchip">
    **510ms ‚Ä¢ Less Accurate ‚Ä¢ Fastest**

    The fastest model, but with reduced reasoning ability.

    - ‚ö°‚ö° Extremely fast (under 1 second)
    - üìù Best for scripted interactions
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited ability to handle unexpected questions

    **Best for:** Appointment reminders, simple confirmations, highly scripted calls where speed matters most

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GPT-4o" icon="brain">
    **600ms ‚Ä¢ Most Accurate ‚Ä¢ Slower**

    The most intelligent GPT-4 model with superior reasoning.

    - üéØ Exceptional accuracy and comprehension
    - üìö Handles complex scenarios excellently
    - üí° Better at handling objections and edge cases
    - ‚è±Ô∏è Slightly slower than GPT-4.1

    **Best for:** Complex sales conversations, technical support, consultative selling, handling difficult customers

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GPT-5" icon="gem">
    **1550ms ‚Ä¢ Smartest ‚Ä¢ Slower**

    The most intelligent model available, but with noticeable latency.

    - üéì Exceptional reasoning capabilities
    - üîç Best for highly complex conversations
    - ‚è±Ô∏è Significant delay (1.5+ seconds) may feel laggy

    **Best for:** High-value consultations where accuracy matters more than speed, complex technical discussions, situations requiring deep reasoning

  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="GPT-5 Nano" icon="window-maximize">
    **1350ms ‚Ä¢ Smart ‚Ä¢ Fastest (of GPT-5 series)**

    The fastest GPT-5 model with good intelligence.

    - üìä Handles longer conversation histories
    - ‚ö° Faster than other GPT-5 models
    - üß† Still intelligent, just not as advanced

    **Best for:** Long conversations requiring extensive context, complex calls that need GPT-5 intelligence with better speed

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  **Choosing the Right Model:** Start with **GPT-4.1** for most use cases. Only
  upgrade to GPT-4o or GPT-5 if you encounter specific scenarios requiring
  higher intelligence. Downgrade to Mini/Nano only if speed is critical and
  conversations are simple.
</Tip>

### Background Sound

Add ambient background noise to make your calls feel more human and authentic.

**Available Options:**

- **Office** ‚Äì General office sounds (keyboard typing, subtle background chatter)
- **Lounge** ‚Äì General lounge sounds (subtle caf√©/waiting room ambience)
- **Mute** ‚Äì No background sound (clean audio only)

**When to Use Background Sound:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="‚úÖ Use for Outbound Sales" icon="check">
    Background sounds make outbound calls feel more authentic and less "robotic." The subtle ambience suggests the caller is in a real office environment.
  </Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="‚úÖ Use for Appointment Reminders" icon="check">
  Light office sounds help the call feel like it's coming from a real
  receptionist.
</Accordion>

{" "}

<Accordion title="‚ùå Avoid for Customer Support" icon="xmark">
  Support calls should be crystal-clear. Background noise can make it harder to
  hear, especially if the customer is in a noisy environment.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="‚ùå Avoid if Volume is an Issue" icon="xmark">
    If your audio levels are inconsistent or too quiet, background sounds can make it worse. Fix audio issues first, then add ambience.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Test with and without background sound to see what feels right for your use
  case. What works for one industry might not work for another.
</Tip>

---

## Knowledge Base

Give your agent access to company information, product details, policies, and more. Choose from three methods:

<Warning>
  **Performance Impact:** Knowledge base lookups add **2-4 seconds of latency**
  per query during calls. Best reserved for inbound reception, help-desk
  scenarios, or when accuracy matters more than speed. For fast-paced outbound
  calls, put FAQs directly in your prompt instead.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Upload" icon="file-arrow-up">
    Drop files directly into the knowledge base‚Äîthe agent will read and understand them.

    **Supported Formats:**
    - üìÑ PDFs
    - üìù Word documents (.docx, .doc)
    - üìä CSV files
    - üìã Plain-text files (.txt)
    - üî§ Markdown files (.md)

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/chat-knowledge-file-upload.png" alt="File Upload" />
    </Frame>

    **Best for:**
    - Product manuals
    - Company policies
    - FAQs
    - Pricing sheets
    - Training materials

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Website Scrape" icon="globe">

## Advanced Settings

Fine-tune your agent's behavior with these powerful configuration options.

### Time Zone

**Essential for accurate appointment booking.**

Set the agent's time zone so it can correctly interpret phrases like "tomorrow at 3pm" or "next Monday morning."

<Note>
  **Critical for booking tools:** Without the correct time zone, appointments
  may be scheduled for the wrong time, causing missed meetings and frustrated
  customers.
</Note>

---

### HIPAA Compliance

**Stop call logs and recordings from being stored.**

When **HIPAA Compliance** is enabled:

- ‚ùå No call recordings are stored
- ‚ùå No transcriptions are saved
- ‚ùå No logs are kept
- ‚úÖ Only basic call metadata (duration, status) is retained

**When to Enable:**

- Healthcare providers
- Legal firms
- Financial services
- Any regulated industry requiring data protection

<Warning>
  **Trade-off:** With HIPAA mode enabled, you won't be able to review call
  recordings for training or quality assurance purposes.
</Warning>

---

### Forwarding Number

**Automatically pass a qualified caller to a live rep.**

Enter a phone number in **E.164 format** (e.g., `+61412345678`) to transfer calls.

**How It Works:**

1. Agent qualifies the lead during the call
2. Agent says: "Great! Let me connect you with one of our specialists."
3. Call is transferred to the forwarding number
4. Live rep picks up and continues the conversation

**Use Cases:**

- Hot leads ready to buy
- Technical questions beyond the agent's scope
- VIP customers requesting personal service
- Emergency or urgent situations

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Use conditional logic in your prompt to decide when to forward.
  For example: "If the caller wants to speak to someone immediately, forward the
  call. Otherwise, book an appointment."
</Tip>

---

### Key Terms

**Improve transcription accuracy for unusual names, brands, suburbs, etc.**

Add terms that the speech-to-text engine might misunderstand. Separate each term with a space.

**Examples:**

```
Outbox Mandurah Fremantle Joondalup CrossFit Pilates HIIT
```

```
Burleigh Currumbin Coolangatta Broadbeach Robina
```

**What to Add:**

- Business names (especially unique spellings)
- Suburb and location names
- Product names and brands
- Industry-specific terminology
- Uncommon proper nouns

<Note>
  Key terms help the transcription engine recognize these words correctly during
  the call, leading to better comprehension and fewer errors.
</Note>

---

### Voicemail Message

**What to say if the system detects voicemail after ~20 seconds.**

**Example:**

```
"Hi {{first_name}}, this is Sarah from Elite Fitness. I was just calling to follow up on your inquiry about our membership. Give us a call back at 08 1234 5678, or I'll try you again later. Have a great day!"
```

**Best Practices:**

- ‚úÖ Keep it under 15 seconds
- ‚úÖ Include your callback number
- ‚úÖ Give a reason for the call
- ‚úÖ Sound natural and friendly
- ‚ùå Don't oversell or sound desperate

<Tip>
  **Leave it blank** if you don't want the agent to leave voicemails. The call
  will simply end and be logged as "no answer."
</Tip>

---

### End Call Message

**Last line before hanging up.**

**Examples:**

```
"Thanks for your time today! You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Have a great day!"
```

```
"Perfect! We'll see you on Tuesday at 3pm. Looking forward to it!"
```

```
"No worries at all. Feel free to call us back if you change your mind. Take care!"
```

**Leave Blank:**

If you want the agent to **disconnect silently** after completing its objective.

---

### Unqualified Prompt

**Define disqualifying criteria so calls are automatically tagged "Unqualified."**

**Example:**

```
Mark the call as unqualified if any of the following are true:
- The caller is a renter (we only work with homeowners)
- The caller is over 75 years old
- The caller is not the decision-maker
- The property is commercial (we only do residential)
```

**Why Use This:**

Unqualified tags integrate with GoHighLevel automations, allowing you to:

- Automatically remove unqualified leads from sequences
- Trigger different follow-up workflows
- Tag contacts for future remarketing
- Keep your pipeline clean and focused

<Tip>
  Be specific! Vague criteria lead to inconsistent tagging. Clear rules ensure
  reliable automation.
</Tip>

---

### Summary Prompt

**Tell Outbox AI how to format the call summary posted back to your CRM.**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/voice-summary-prompt.png" alt="Summary Prompt" />
</Frame>

**Example:**

```
Summarize this call in 2-3 sentences. Include:
- The caller's main question or goal
- Whether an appointment was booked (and when)
- Any objections or concerns mentioned

### Scoring Prompt

**Define how the call should be scored from 0-100.**

**Example:**

```
Rate how successful this call was from 0-100. 0 means a true failure: caller was upset/angry, tools malfunctioned, or a serious error occurred.
100 means a perfect outcome: caller was engaged, happy, and all tools worked correctly.
50 means a neutral/middle call where some interaction happened but nothing notable was achieved.
If the call was very short (1-5 seconds), unanswered, or had no meaningful interaction, do NOT score it as 0. Instead, treat it as a neutral/no-outcome call (e.g., 30-40).
Consider caller engagement, tool success, and overall outcome when assigning the score.
```

**How to Use Scores:**

- Route high-scoring leads to sales immediately
- Add low-scoring leads to nurture campaigns
- Track conversion rates by score range
- Optimize agent performance over time

<Note>
  Scores are returned with the call completion webhook and visible in
  GoHighLevel custom fields.
</Note>

### Webhook URL

**Where to send the end-of-call report.**

Enter a URL to receive a POST request with detailed call information immediately after each call completes.

**Request Format:**

The webhook sends a POST request with the following JSON payload:

```json

### Recording Consent Message

**What to tell the user if you're recording the call.**

**Example:**

```
"Just so you know, this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes."
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with GPT-4.1" icon="star">
    Don't overthink model selection. GPT-4.1 handles 95% of use cases perfectly. Only upgrade if you encounter specific limitations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Voice Quality First" icon="headphones">
  Before writing a complex prompt, test the voice itself:
  
  1. Create a simple "Hello, this is a test" agent
  2. Call yourself
  3. Evaluate clarity, tone, and professionalism
  4. Try 2-3 different voices
  5. Pick the winner, then build your prompt
</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep First Messages Short" icon="message">
    The first 3 seconds determine whether someone hangs up or engages:
    
    ‚úÖ Good: "Hi Sarah, this is Jake from Elite Fitness. Quick question about your inquiry‚Äîgot a minute?"
    
    ‚ùå Bad: "Hello! Thank you so much for your interest in Elite Fitness. My name is Jake and I'm calling today to follow up on the form you submitted on our website about our premium membership packages..."
    
    Get to the point fast.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Key Terms Liberally" icon="key">
  If you're getting transcription errors (wrong suburb names, mangled product
  names), don't hesitate to add 20-30 key terms. It makes a huge difference.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Latency" icon="gauge">
    If your agent feels "laggy":
    
    - Remove knowledge base (adds 2-4s per query)
    - Downgrade model (GPT-5 ‚Üí GPT-4.1)
    - Simplify tool complexity
    - Shorten your prompt
    
    Speed matters in voice. Aim for under 1.5 second response times.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Conversations Weekly" icon="calendar">
    Listen to 5-10 calls every week:
    
    - What objections keep coming up?
    - Where does the agent get confused?
    - What questions can't it answer?
    - Where do people hang up?
    
    Update your prompt based on real patterns, not assumptions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Sounds Robotic" icon="robot">
    **Problem:** The voice feels unnatural or scripted.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Enable **Background Sound** (Office or Lounge)
    - Add filler words to your prompt ("um," "ah," "let me check")
    - Use contractions ("I'm" not "I am," "we're" not "we are")
    - Test a different voice with more personality
    - Avoid overly formal language in your prompt
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Poor Call Quality" icon="phone-slash">
    **Problem:** Audio is choppy, quiet, or unclear.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Test a different voice provider
    - Disable background sound if volume is low
    - Check that the caller's connection is stable
    - Verify you're not exceeding concurrent call limits
    - Contact support if issue persists across multiple calls
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Taking Too Long to Respond" icon="clock">
    **Problem:** Long pauses between responses (over 3 seconds).

    - Disable knowledge base if enabled
    - Switch to a faster model (GPT-5 ‚Üí GPT-4.1)
    - Simplify tool logic and reduce API calls
    - Shorten your prompt (aim for under 2,000 words)
    - Remove complex conditional logic
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tools Not Triggering" icon="wrench">
    **Problem:** The agent isn't using the tools you've configured.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Make tool usage **explicit** in your prompt: "When the caller wants to book, use the book_appointment tool"
    - Test the tool manually to ensure it's working
    - Check API keys and authentication
    - Review tool logs for error messages
    - Simplify the tool trigger conditions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Transcription Errors" icon="closed-captioning">
    **Problem:** Names, locations, or terms are misheard.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add problematic words to **Key Terms**
    - Use phonetic spelling if needed (e.g., "Mandjoogoordap" for "Mandogalup")
    - Test in a quiet environment first
    - Ensure the caller speaks clearly
    - Switch to a model with better transcription (GPT-4o or GPT-5)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calls Going to Queue" icon="list">
    **Problem:** Calls aren't being placed immediately.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check your **wallet balance** ‚Äì top up if low
    - Verify you haven't hit your **concurrent call limit**
    - Review scheduled callback times
    - Resume the queue if it's paused
    - Contact support to increase limits if needed
